<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>KIT AND THE GIRL OF THE LARK CALL</h3>
</div>
<p>In the shade of Pedro Vijil&rsquo;s little brown adobe on
the Granados rancho, a horseman squatted to repair
a broken cinch with strips of rawhide, while his horse&ndash;&ndash;a
strong dappled roan with a smutty face&ndash;&ndash;stood near,
the rawhide bridle over his head and the quirt trailing
the ground.</p>
<p>The horseman&rsquo;s frame of mind was evidently not of
the sweetest, for to Vijil he had expressed himself in
forcible Mexican&ndash;&ndash;which is supposed to be Spanish and
often isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;condemning the luck by which the cinch
had gone bad at the wrong time, and as he tinkered he
sang softly an old southern ditty:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Oh&ndash;&ndash;oh! I&rsquo;m a good old rebel,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Now that&rsquo;s just what I am!<br />
For I won&rsquo;t be reconstructed<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And I don&rsquo;t care a damn!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He varied this musical gem occasionally by whistling
the air as he punched holes and wove the rawhide thongs
in and out through the spliced leather.</p>
<p>Once he halted in the midst of a strain and lifted his
head, listening. Something like an echo of his own notes
sounded very close, a mere shadow of a whistle.</p>
<p>Directly over his head was a window, unglazed and
wooden barred. A fat brown olla, dripping moisture,
almost filled the deep window sill, but the interior was
all in shadow. Its one door was closed. The Vijil family
was scattered around in the open, most of them under
the <i>ramada</i>, and after a frowning moment of mystification
the young fellow resumed his task, but in silence.</p>
<p>Then, after a still minute, more than the whisper of
a whistle came to him&ndash;&ndash;the subdued sweet call of a
meadow lark. It was so sweet it might have been mate
to any he had heard on the range that morning.</p>
<p>Only an instant he hesitated, then with equal care he
gave the duplicate call, and held his breath to listen&ndash;&ndash;not
a sound came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone loco, Pardner,&rdquo; he observed to the
smutty-faced roan moving near him. &ldquo;That jolt from
the bay outlaw this morning has jingled my brain pans&ndash;&ndash;we
don&rsquo;t hear birds call us&ndash;&ndash;we only think we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had even looked at Pardner he might have been
given a sign, for the roan had lifted its head and was
staring into the shadows back of the sweating olla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you caballero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were too clear to be mistaken, the &ldquo;caballero&rdquo;
stared across to the only people in sight. There
was Pedro Vijil sharpening an axe, while Merced, his
wife, turned the creaking grindstone for him. The young
olive branches of the Vijil family were having fun with
a horned toad under the <i>ramada</i> where gourd vines
twisted about an ancient grape, and red peppers hung in
a gorgeous splash of color. Between that and the blue
haze of the far mountains there was no sign of humanity
to account for such cheery youthful Americanism as the
tone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, yourself!&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;whose ghost are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a giggle from the barred window of the
adobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare say because I am not respectable just
now,&rdquo; replied the voice. &ldquo;I fell in the ditch and have
nothing on but the Sunday shirt of Pedro. I am the
funniest looking thing! wish I dared ride home in it to
shock them all silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked, and again the girlish laugh
gave him an odd thrill of comradeship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good enough reason; they&rsquo;d take Pat from me,
and say he wasn&rsquo;t safe to ride&ndash;&ndash;but he is! My tumble
was my own fault for letting them put on that fool English
saddle. Never again for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all right for old folks and a pacing pony,&rdquo;
he observed, and again he heard the bubbling laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Pat is not a pacing pony, not by a long shot;
and I&rsquo;m not old folks&ndash;&ndash;yet!&rdquo; Then after a little silence,
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any curiosity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there&rsquo;s none allowed me on this count,&rdquo; he
replied without lifting his head, &ldquo;between the wooden
bars and Pedro&rsquo;s shirt you certainly put the fences up
on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a damsel in distress waiting for a rescuing knight
with a white banner and a milk-white steed&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; went on
the laughing voice in stilted declamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, friend, but my cayuse is a roan, and I never
carried a white flag yet. You pick the wrong colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he began the chanting of a war song, with
an eye stealthily on the barred window.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Hurrah! Hurrah! For southern rights, hurrah!<br />
Hurrah for the bonnie blue flag<br />
That bears the single star!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>I</i> know that!&rdquo; the voice was now a hail of recognition.
&ldquo;Cap Pike always sings that when he&rsquo;s a little
&lsquo;how-came-ye-so&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;and <i>you&rsquo;re</i> a Johnny Reb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! twice removed,&rdquo; assented the man by the wall,
&ldquo;and you are a raiding Yank who has been landed in
one of our fortresses with only one shirt to her back,
and that one borrowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a momentary vision of two laughing gray
eyes beside the olla, and the girl behind the bars laughed
until Merced let the grindstone halt while she cast a
glance towards the house as if in doubt as to whether
three feet of adobe wall and stout bars could serve
instead of a due&ntilde;a to foolish young Americans who
chattered according to their foolishness.</p>
<p>There was an interval of silence, and then the girlish
voice called again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Johnny Reb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you, Miss Yank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the new Americano from California, for
the La Partida rancho?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, O wise one of the borrowed garment.&rdquo; The
laugh came to him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask how I know?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is borne in upon me that you are a witch of the
desert, or the ghost of a dream, that you see through the
adobe wall, and my equally thick skull. Far be it for
me to doubt that the gift of second sight is yours, O
seventh daughter of a seventh daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing! I&rsquo;m the only one!&rdquo; came the quick
retort, and the young chap in the shade of the adobe
shook with silent mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you laughing, Mr. Johnny Reb, you think you
caught me that time. But you just halt and listen to
me, I&rsquo;ve a hunch and I&rsquo;m going to prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you had the gift of second sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t believe me, but the hunch is that
you&ndash;&ndash;won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;hold&ndash;&ndash;the job on these ranches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; and he turned square around facing the window,
then laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way you mean to get
even for the &lsquo;seventh daughter&rsquo; guess is it? You think
I can&rsquo;t handle horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix,&rdquo; was the inelegant reply, &ldquo;I know you can, for
I saw you handle that bay outlaw they ran in on you this
morning: seven years old and no wrangler in Pima could
ride him. Old Cap Pike said it was a damn shame to
put you up against that sun-fisher as an introduction to
Granados.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Pike did, did he? Nice and sympathetic of Pike.
I reckon he&rsquo;s the old-time ranger I heard about out at
the Junction, reading a red-fire riot to some native sons
who were not keen for the cactus trail of the Villistas.
That old captain must be a live wire, but he thinks I can&rsquo;t
stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, that wasn&rsquo;t Cap Pike, that was my own
hunch. Say, are you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O se&ntilde;orita! this is so sudden!&rdquo; he spoke in shy
reproof, twisting his neckerchief in mock embarrassment,
and again Merced looked toward the house because
of peals of laughter there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are certainly funny when you do that,&rdquo; she said
after her laughter had quieted down to giggles, &ldquo;but I
wasn&rsquo;t joking, honest Indian I wasn&rsquo;t! But how did you
come to strike Granados?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Well, I ranged over from California to sell a
patch of ground I owned in Yuma. Then I hiked over
to Nogales on a little <i>pasear</i> and offered to pack a gun
and wear a uniform for this Mexican squabble, and the
powers that be turned me down because one of my eyes
could see farther than the other&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s no joke&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
a calamity! I spent all the <i>dinero</i> I had recovering from
the shock, and about the time I was getting my sympathetic
friends sobered up, Singleton, of Granados, saw us
trying out some raw cavalry stock, and bid for my valuable
services and I rode over. Any other little detail
you&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no, only needed to know it wasn&rsquo;t Conrad the
manager hired you, and I asked if you were married because
married men need the work more than single strays.
Adolf Conrad got rid of two good American men lately,
and fetches over Mexicans from away down Hermosillo
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause why?&rdquo; asked the man who had ceased pretense
of mending the saddle, and was standing with back
against the adobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; came petulant response. &ldquo;I
only had the hunch when I saw you tame that outlaw in
the corral. If he pulls wires to lose <i>you</i>, I&rsquo;ll stop guessing;
I&rsquo;ll know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; agreed the stranger reflectively.
&ldquo;But if I have a good job, I can&rsquo;t see how it
will give me aid or comfort to know that you&rsquo;ve acquired
knowledge, and stopped guessing. When&rsquo;s your time up
behind the bars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever my clothes get dry enough to fool the dear
home folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a joy to the bosom of your family,&rdquo;
he observed, &ldquo;also a blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard again the girlish laughter and concluded she
could not be over sixteen. There was silence for a space
while only the creak of the grindstone cut the stillness.
Whoever she was, she had given him a brief illuminating
vision of the tactics of Conrad, the manager for the
ranches of Granados and La Partida, the latter being the
Sonora end of the old Spanish land grant. Even a girl
had noted that the rough work had been turned over to
a new American from the first circle of the <i>rodeo</i>. He
stood there staring out across the sage green to the far
purple hills of the Green Springs range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fixed that cinch, what you waiting for?&rdquo;
asked the voice at last, and the young fellow straightened
up and lifted the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;But as you whistled
to me and the call seemed friendly, it was up to me to
halt for orders&ndash;&ndash;from the lady in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he heard the soft laughter and the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you liked the friendly call, Johnny Reb,&rdquo; she
confessed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my call. If ever you hear it where
there are no larks, you&rsquo;ll know who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed, yanking at the cinch, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll come
a lopin&rsquo; with the bonnie blue flag, to give aid and succor
to the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just whistle
back friendly, and be chums. I think my clothes are dry
now, and you&rsquo;d better travel. If you meet anyone looking
for a stray maverick, you haven&rsquo;t seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say. <i>Adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had mounted and passed along the corral to
the road, he turned in the saddle and looked back. He
could see no one in the window of the bars, but there came
to him clear and sweet the field bugle of the meadow
lark.</p>
<p>He answered it, lifted his sombrero and rode soberly
towards the Granados corrals, three miles across the
valley. Queer little trick she must be. American girls
did not usually ride abroad alone along the border, and
certainly did not chum with the Mexicans to the extent
of borrowing shirts. Then as he lifted the bridle and
Pardner broke into a lope, he noted an elderly horseman
jogging along across trail on a little mule. Each eyed
the other appraisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bub!&rdquo; hailed the older man. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s
Pike, and you&rsquo;re the new man from California, hey?
Glad to meet you. Hear your name&rsquo;s Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you heard right,&rdquo; agreed the young chap.
&ldquo;K. Rhodes at your service, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! K? K? Does that K stand for Kit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Center shot for you,&rdquo; assented the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Tennessee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re a sort of family historian, I reckon, Mr.
Pike,&rdquo; suggested K. Rhodes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the excitement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you young plantation stray!&rdquo; and the older
man reached for his hand and made use of it pump-handle
fashion with a sort of sputtering glee. &ldquo;Great
guns, boy! there was just one K. Rhodes a-top of God&rsquo;s
green earth and we were pardners here in Crook&rsquo;s day.
Hurrah for us! Are you cousin, son, or nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather was with Crook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! I knew it soon as I laid eyes on you and heard
your name; that was in the corral with the outlaw Conrad
had driven in for you to work, it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a square deal
to a white man. I was cussin&rsquo; mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; and the blue eyes of the other smiled
at the memory of the girl&rsquo;s glib repetition of his discourse.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the great idea? Aside from the fact
that he belongs to the white dove, anti-military bunch
of sisters, Singleton seems quite white, a nice chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, but he&rsquo;s noways wise at that. He sort of married
into the horse game here, wasn&rsquo;t bred to it. Just
knows enough to not try to run it solo. Now this Dolf
Conrad does know horses and the horse market, and
Granados rancho. He&rsquo;s shipped more cavalry stock to
France than any other outfit in this region. Yes, Conrad
knows the business end of the game, but even at that he
might not assay as high grade ore. He is mixed up with
them too-proud-to-fight clique organized by old maids of
both sexes, and to show that he is above all prejudice,
political or otherwise, he sure is corraling an extra lot
of Mex help this year. I&rsquo;ve <i>companeros</i>
I&rsquo;d go through
hell for, but Conrad&rsquo;s breed&ndash;&ndash;well, enough said, Bub,
but they&rsquo;re different!&rdquo; Mr. Pike bit off a chew of black
plug, and shook his head ruminatively.</p>
<p>Rhodes looked the old man over as they rode along
side by side. He was lean, wiry and probably sixty-five.
His hair, worn long, gave him the look of the old-time
ranger. He carried no <i>reata</i> and did not look like a
ranchman. He had the southern intonation, and his eyes
were wonderfully young for the almost snowy hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belong in the valley, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belong? Me belong anywhere? Not yet, son,&rdquo; and
he smiled at his own fancy. &ldquo;Not but what it&rsquo;s a good
enough corner when a man reaches the settlin&rsquo; down age.
I drift back every so often. This ranch was Fred Bernard&rsquo;s,
and him and me flocked together for quite a spell.
Singleton married Bernard&rsquo;s widow&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s dead now
these seven years. I just drift back every so often to keep
track of Bernard&rsquo;s kid, Billie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Glad to have met you, Captain. Hope we can
ride together often enough for me to hear about the old
Apache days. This land has fetched out three generations
of us, so it surely has some pull! My father came
at the end of his race, but I&rsquo;ve come in time to grow up
with the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pike looked at him and chuckled. K. Rhodes
was about twenty-three, tall, almost boyish in figure, but
his shoulders and hands suggested strength, and his mouth
had little dents of humor at the corners to mitigate the
squareness of jaw and the heavy dark brows. His black
lashes made the deep blue of his eyes look purple. Young
he was, but with a stature and self-reliant manner as witness
of the fact that he was fairly grown up already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you learn horses, Bub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tennessee stock farm, and southern California
ranges. Then this neck of the woods seemed calling me,
and I trailed over to look after a bit of land in Yuma.
I wasted some time trying to break into the army, but they
found some eye defect that I don&rsquo;t know anything about&ndash;&ndash;and
don&rsquo;t more than half believe! I had some dandy
prospecting plans after that, but there was no jingling in
my pockets&ndash;&ndash;no outfit money, so I hailed Singleton as an
angel monoplaned down with the ducats. Yes sir, I had
all the dream survey made for a try at some gold trails
down here, going to take it up where the rest of the
family quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that, boy?&rdquo; The old man halted his mule,
and spat out the tobacco, staring at Rhodes in eager
anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do. Reckon I&rsquo;ve inherited the fever, and can&rsquo;t
settle down to any other thing until I&rsquo;ve had one try at it.
Did do a little placer working in the San Jacinto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re broke?&rdquo; Mr. Pike&rsquo;s voice betrayed a
keen joy in the prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flat,&rdquo; stated K. Rhodes, eyeing the old gentleman
suspiciously, &ldquo;my horse, saddle, field glass, and gun are
the only belongings in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ki-yi!&rdquo; chirruped his new acquaintance gleefully,
&ldquo;I knew when I got out of the blankets this morning I
was to have good luck of some sort, had a &lsquo;hunch.&rsquo; You
can bet on me, Bub; you&rsquo;ve struck the right rail, and I&rsquo;m
your friend, your desert <i>companero</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you sound real nice and friendly,&rdquo; agreed K.
Rhodes. &ldquo;So glad I&rsquo;m flat broke that you&rsquo;re having
hysterics over it. Typical southern hospitality. Hearty
welcome to our city, and so forth, and so forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man grinned at him appreciatively. &ldquo;Lord
boy!&ndash;&ndash;I reckon I&rsquo;ve been waiting around for you about
ten year, though I didn&rsquo;t know what your name would
be when you come, and it couldn&rsquo;t be a better one! We&rsquo;ll
outfit first for the Three Hills of Gold in the desert, and
if luck is against us there we&rsquo;ll strike down into Sonora
to have a try after the red gold of El Alisal. I&rsquo;ve covered
some of that ground, but never had a pardner who would
stick. They&rsquo;d beat it because of either the Mexicans or
the Indians, but <i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;say boy! It&rsquo;s the greatest game
in the world and we&rsquo;ll go to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His young eyes sparkled in his weathered desert face,
and more than ten years were cast aside in his enthusiasm.
K. Rhodes looked at him askance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did not have a key to your sane and calm outlining
of prospects for the future, I might suspect loco
weed or some other dope,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;But the fact
is you must have known that my grandfather in his day
went on the trail of the Three Hills of Gold, and left
about a dozen different plans on paper for future trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know it? Why boy, I went in with him!&rdquo; shrilled
Captain Pike. &ldquo;Know it? Why, we crawled out half
starved, and dried out as a couple of last year&rsquo;s gourds.
We dug roots and were chewing our own boot tops when
the Indians found us. Sure, I know it. He went East to
raise money for a bigger outfit, but never got back&ndash;&ndash;died
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, then my father gathered up all the plans and
specifications and came out with a friend about fifteen
years ago,&rdquo; added Rhodes. &ldquo;They never got anywhere,
but he sort of worked the fever off, bought some land
and hit the trail back home. So I&rsquo;ve been fairly well fed
up on your sort of dope, Captain, and when I&rsquo;ve mended
that gone feeling in my pocketbook I may &lsquo;call&rsquo; you on
the gold trail proposition. Even if you&rsquo;re bluffing there&rsquo;ll
be no come back; I can listen to a lot of &lsquo;lost mine&rsquo;
vagaries. It sounds like home sweet home to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bluff nothing! we&rsquo;ll start next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve got a job and made a promise,
got to help clean up the work here for the winter. Promised
to take the next load of horses East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new one,&rdquo; observed his new friend. &ldquo;Conrad
himself has always gone East with the horses, or sent
Brehmen, his secretary. But never mind, Bub, the eastern
trip won&rsquo;t take long. I&rsquo;ll be devilin&rsquo; around getting our
outfit and when the chance comes&ndash;&ndash;us for the Three
Hills of Gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It listens well,&rdquo; agreed K. Rhodes, &ldquo;cheeriest little
<i>pasear</i> I&rsquo;ve struck in the county. We&rsquo;ll have some great
old powwows, even if we don&rsquo;t make a cent, and some
day you&rsquo;ll tell me about the mental kinks in the makeup
of our Prussian friend, Conrad. He sounds interesting
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pike uttered a profane and lurid word or two
concerning Mr. Conrad, and stated he&rsquo;d be glad when
Billie was of age. Singleton, and therefore Conrad,
would only have the management up to that time. Billie
would know horses if nothing else, and&ndash;&ndash;Then he interrupted
himself and stared back the way he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a forgetful old fool!&rdquo; he stated with conviction.
&ldquo;I meandered out to take a look around for her, and I
didn&rsquo;t like the looks of that little dab of a saddle Conrad
had put on Pat. You didn&rsquo;t see anything of her, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slip of a girl who rides like an Indian, rides a
black horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve seen no one,&rdquo; said the young chap truthfully
enough. &ldquo;But who did you say your girl was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out if you hold your job long enough for
her to be of age,&rdquo; said Pike darkly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be your
boss instead of Conrad. It&rsquo;s Billie Bernard, the owner of
Granados and La Partida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Wilfreda, if you like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But K. Rhodes said he didn&rsquo;t. Billie seemed to fit the
sort of girl who would garb herself in Pedro&rsquo;s shirt and
whistle at him through the bars of the little window.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE RED GOLD LEGEND</h3>
</div>
<p>It took less than a week for Kit Rhodes to conclude
that the girl behind the bars had a true inspiration
regarding his own position on her ranches. There was
no open hostility to him, yet it was evident that difficulties
were cleverly put in his way.</p>
<p>Not by Philip Singleton, the colorless, kindly disposed
gentleman of Pike&rsquo;s description. But by various intangible
methods, he was made to feel an outsider by the
manager, Conrad, and his more confidential Mexican assistants.
They were punctiliously polite, too polite for a
horse-ranch outfit. Yet again and again a group of them
fell silent when he joined them, and as his work was
with the horse herds of La Partida, that part of the great
grant which spread over the border into Sonora, he was
often camped fifty miles south of the hacienda of Granados,
and saw no more of either the old prospector, or the
tantalizing girl of the voice and the whistle.</p>
<p>Conrad, however, motored down two or three times
concerning horses for eastern shipment, but Rhodes, the
new range capitan, puzzled considerably over those flying
visits, for, after the long drive through sand and alkali,
the attention he gave either herds or outfit was negligible.
In fact he scarcely touched at the camp, yet always did
some trifling official act coming or going to make record
that he had been there.</p>
<p>The Mexicans called him El Aoura, the buzzard, because
no man could tell when he would swoop over even
the farthest range of La Partida to catch them napping.
Yet there was some sort of curious bond between them
for there were times when Conrad came north as from
a long southern trail, yet the Mexicans were as dumb
men if it was referred to.</p>
<p>He was a compactly built, fair man of less than forty,
with thin reddish brown hair, brows slanting downward
from the base of the nose, and a profile of that curious
Teuton type reminiscent of a supercilious hound if one
could imagine such an animal with milk-blue eyes and
a yellow mustache with spiky turned-up ends.</p>
<p>But Rhodes did not permit any antipathy he might feel
towards the man to interfere with his own duties, and
he went stolidly about the range work as if in utter forgetfulness
of the dark prophecy of the girl.</p>
<p>If he was to lose his new job he did not mean that it
should be from inattention, and nothing was too trifling
for his notice. He would do the work of a range boss
twelve hours out of the day, and then put in extra time
on a night ride to the <i>cantina</i> at the south wells of La
Partida.</p>
<p>But as the work moved north and the consignment of
horses for France made practically complete, old Cap Pike
rode down to Granados corrals, and after contemplation
of the various activities of Rhodes, climbed up on the
corral fence beside him, where the latter was checking
off the accepted animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheerful idiot for work, Bub,&rdquo; agreed the
old man, &ldquo;but what the devil do you gain by doing so
much of the other fellow&rsquo;s job? Pancho Martinez wasn&rsquo;t
sick as he played off on you; you&rsquo;re green to these Mexican
tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m the original Green from Greenburg,&rdquo; assented
his new <i>companero</i>. &ldquo;Pancho was only more than
usually drunk last night, while I was fresh as a daisy and
eager to enlarge my geographic knowledge, also my linguistics,
Hi! Pedro! not the sorrel mare! Cut her out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linguistics?&rdquo; repeated Pike impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, nice little woman in the cantina at La Partida
wells. I am a willing pupil at Spanish love songs, and we
get along fine. I am already a howling success at <i>La
Paloma</i>, <i>La Golondrina</i>, and a few other sentimental
birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are, are you?&rdquo; queried Pike. &ldquo;Well, take
a warning. You&rsquo;ll get a knife in your back from her
man one of these fine nights, and the song will be <i>Adios,
adios amores</i> for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Cap! We play <i>malilla</i> for the drinks,
and I work it so that he beats me two out of three. I&rsquo;m
so easy I&rsquo;m not worth watching. Women don&rsquo;t fancy
fools, so I&rsquo;m safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;strafed&rsquo; by the Dutch!&rdquo; Pike stared at
the young fellow, frowning in perplexity. &ldquo;You sure
have me puzzled, Bub. Are you a hopeless dunce by
training or nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural product,&rdquo; grinned K. Rhodes cheerfully.
&ldquo;Beauty unadorned. Say Cap, tell me something. What
is the attraction for friend Conrad south of La Partida?
I seem to run against a stone wall when I try to feel out
the natives on that point. Now just what lies south, and
whose territory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him with a new keenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your sort of an idiot you&rsquo;ve blundered on a big
interrogation point,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Did you meet him
down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only heard his voice in the night. It&rsquo;s not very
easy to mistake that velvety blood-puddin&rsquo; voice of his,
and a team went down to meet him. He seems to go
down by another route, railroad I reckon, and comes in
by the south ranch. Now just what is south?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ranches of Soledad grant join La Partida, or
aim to. There are no maps, and no one here knows
how far down over the border the Partida leagues do
reach. Soledad was an old mission site, and a fortified
hacienda back in the days of Juarez. Its owner was convicted
of treason during Diaz&rsquo; reign, executed, and the
ranches confiscated. It is now in the hands of a Federal
politician who is safer in Hermosillo. The revolutionists
are thick even among the pacificos up here, but the
Federals have the most ammunition, and the gods of war
are with the guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; and who is the Federal politician? No, not
that colt, Marcito!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perez, Don Jos&eacute; Perez,&rdquo; stated Pike, giving no heed
to corral interpolations. &ldquo;He claims more leagues than
have ever been reckoned or surveyed, took in several
Indian rancherias last year when the natives were
rounded up and shipped to Yucatan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is in that slave trade good and plenty! They
say he is sore on the Yaquis because he lost a lot of
money on a boat load that committed suicide as they
were sailing from Guaymas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat load of suicides! Now a couple of dozen
would sound reasonable, but a boat load&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it happened to every Indian on the boat, and the
boat was full! No one knows how the poor devils decided
it, but it was their only escape from slavery, and
they went over the side like a school of fish. Men,
women, and children from the desert who couldn&rsquo;t swim
a stroke! Talk about nerve&ndash;&ndash;there wasn&rsquo;t one weakling
in that whole outfit, not one! Perez was wild. It lost
him sixty dollars a head, American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the neighbor friend Conrad takes a run
down south to see occasionally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so, Bub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two looked at each other, eyes questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, son,&rdquo; said Pike, after a little, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hit any
trail with you barring Mexican politics. They all sell
each other out as regular as the seasons swing around,
and the man north of the line who gets tangled is sure
to be victim if he stays in long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! We have a statesman or two who
flirted with Sonora and came out ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said if he stayed in,&rdquo; reminded Pike. &ldquo;Sure we
have crooks galore who drift across, play a cut-throat
game and skip back to cover. The border is lined with
them on both sides. And Conrad&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Conrad isn&rsquo;t in politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no. There&rsquo;s no evidence that he is, but his
Mexican friends are. There are men on the Granados
now who used to be down on Soledad, and they are the
men who make the trips with him to the lower ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomas Herrara and Chico Domingo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve sized them up, but remember, Kit,
I don&rsquo;t cross over with you for any political game, and
I don&rsquo;t know a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Captain, but don&rsquo;t raise too loud a howl if
I fancy a <i>pasear</i> occasionally to improve my Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man grumbled direful and profane prophecies
as to things likely to happen to students of Spanish love
songs in Sonora, and then sat with his head on one side
studying Kit ruminatively as he made his notes of the
selected stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know Bub, it mightn&rsquo;t be so bad at that, if you
called a halt in time, for one of the lost mine trails calls
for Spanish and plenty of it. I&rsquo;ve got a working knowledge,
but the farther you travel into Sonora the less
American you will hear, and that lost mine of the old
padres is down there along the ranges of Soledad somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of the fifty-seven varieties have you
elected to uncover first?&rdquo; queried Rhodes. &ldquo;The last
time you were confidential about mines I thought the
&lsquo;Three Hills of Gold&rsquo; were mentioned by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was, but since you are on the Sonora end of
the ranch, and since you are picking up your ears to learn
Sonoran trails, it might be a good time to follow your
luck. Say, I&rsquo;ll bet that every herder who drifts into the
<i>cantina</i> at La Partida has heard of the red gold of El
Alisal. The Yaquis used to know where it was before
so many of them were killed off; reckon it&rsquo;s lost good
and plenty now, but nothing is hid forever and it&rsquo;s waiting
there for some man with the luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re willing,&rdquo; grinned Kit. &ldquo;You are a great little
old dreamer, Captain. And there is a fair chance I may
range down there. I met a chap named Whitely from
over toward the Painted Hills north of Altar. Ranch
manager, sort of friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Tom Whitely has some stock in a ranch over
there&ndash;&ndash;the Mesa Blanca ranch&ndash;&ndash;it joins Soledad on the
west. I&rsquo;ve always aimed to range that way, but the lost
mine is closer than the eastern sierras&ndash;&ndash;must be! The
trail of the early padres was farther east, and the mine
could not well be far from the trail, not more than a day&rsquo;s
journey by mule or burro, and that&rsquo;s about twenty miles.
You see Bub, it was found by a padre who wandered
off the trail on the way to a little branch mission, or
<i>visita</i>, as they call it, and it was where trees grew, for a
big alisal tree&ndash;&ndash;sycamore you know&ndash;&ndash;was near the outcrop
of that red gold. Well, that <i>visita</i> was where the
padres only visited the heathen for baptism and such
things; no church was built there! That&rsquo;s what tangles
the trail for anyone trying to find traces after a hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it would,&rdquo; agreed Rhodes. &ldquo;Think what
a hundred years of cactus, sand, and occasional <i>temblors</i>
can do to a desert, to say nothing of the playful zephyrs.
Why, Cap, the winds could lift a good-sized range of
hills and fill the baby rivers with it in that time, for the
winds of the desert have a way with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boy rode out of the whirls of dust, and climbed up
on the corral fence where Rhodes was finishing tally of
the horses selected for shipment. He was the slender,
handsome son of Tomas Herrara of whom they had been
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a letter,&rdquo; he said, taking a folded paper from his
hat. &ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Conrad is having the telegraph, and
the cars are to be ready for Granados.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Juanito,&rdquo; agreed Rhodes. &ldquo;Tell
Se&ntilde;or Conrad I will reach Granados for supper, and
that all the stock is in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad whirled away again, riding joyously north, and
Rhodes, after giving final directions to the vaqueros,
turned his roan in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ride back with you, Cap, for I&rsquo;m taking a little
<i>pasear</i> around past Herrara&rsquo;s rancheria. I want to take
a look at that bunch of colts and size up the water there.
I&rsquo;ve a hunch they had better be headed up the other valley
to the Green Springs tank till rains come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pike jogged off alone after some audible and
highly colored remarks concerning range bosses who
assumed the power of the Almighty to be everywhere the
same day. Yet as he watched the younger man disappear
over the gray-green range he smiled tolerantly for, after
all, that sort of a hustler was the right sort of partner
for a prospecting trip.</p>
<p>The late afternoon was a golden haze under a metal
blue sky; afar to the east, sharp edges of the mountains
cut purple zig-zags into the salmon pink of the horizon.
The rolling waves of the ranges were bathed in a sea of
rest, and now and then a bird on the mesquite along an
arroya, or resting on branch of flaring occotilla would
give out the foreboding call of the long shadows, for the
heart of the day had come and gone, and the cooler
air was waking the hidden things from siesta.</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes kept the roan at a steady lope along
the cattle trail, drinking in the refreshing sweetness of
the lonely ranges after hours of dust and heat and the
trampling horse herds of the corrals. Occasionally he
broke into songs of the ranges, love songs, death laments,
and curious sentimental ditties of love and wars of old
England as still crooned in the cabins of southern mountains.</p>

<p>The ancient song of the sad bride whose lover proved
false in the &ldquo;low, low lands of Holland&rdquo; trailed lugubriously

<p>Then, after long stretches of sand dunes, mesquite
thickets, occasional wide ca&ntilde;ons where <i>zacatan</i> meadows
rippled like waves of the sea in the desert air, he swung
his horse around a low hill and came in sight of the little
adobe of Herrara, a place of straggly enclosures of stakes
and wattles, with the corral at the back.</p>
<p>Another rider came over the hill beyond the corral, on
a black horse skimming the earth. Rhodes stared and
whistled softly as the black without swerving planted its
feet and slid down the declivity by the water tank, and
then, jumping the fence below, sped to the little <i>ramada</i>
before the adobe where its rider slid to the ground amid
a deal of barking of dogs and scattering of children.</p>
<p>And although Kit had never seen the rider before, he
had no difficulty as to recognition, and on a sudden impulse
he whistled the meadow-lark call loudly enough to
reach her ears.</p>
<p>She halted at the door, a bundle in her hand, and surveyed
the landscape, but failed to see him because he at
that moment was back of a clump of towering prickly
pear. And she passed on into the shadows of the adobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the disadvantage of being too perfect, Pardner,&rdquo;
he confided to the roan, &ldquo;she thinks we are a pair
of birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned at the corner of the corral and rode around
it which took him back of the house and out of range
from the door, but the dogs set up a ki-yi-ing, and a flock
of youngsters scuttled to the corner of the adobe, and
stared as children of the far ranges are prone to stare at
the passing of a traveler from the longed-for highways
of the world.</p>
<p>The barking of the dogs and scampering of the children
evidently got on the nerves of the black horse left standing
at the vine-covered <i>ramada</i>, for after a puppy had
barked joyously at his heels he leaped aside, and once
turned around kept on going, trotting around the corral
after the roan.</p>
<p>Rhodes saw it but continued on his way, knowing he
could pick it up on his return, as the Ojo Verde tank was
less than a mile away. A boy under the <i>ramada</i> gave one
quick look and then fled, a flash of brown and a red
flapping end of a sash, up the ca&ntilde;oncita where the home
spring was shadowed by a large mesquite tree.</p>
<p>At first Rhodes turned in the saddle with the idea of
assisting in the catching of the black if that was the thing
desired, but it evidently was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what has that <i>muchacho</i> on his mind that he
makes that sort of get-away after nothing and no pursuer
in sight? Pardner, I reckon we&rsquo;ll squander a valuable
minute or two and gather in that black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He galloped back, caught the wanderer but kept right
on without pause to the trickle of water under the flat
wide-spreading tree&ndash;&ndash;it was a solitaire, being king of
its own domain and the only shade, except the vine-covered
<i>ramada</i>, for a mile.</p>
<p>The startled boy made a movement as if to run again
as Kit rode up, then halted, fear and fateful resignation
changing the childish face to sullenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes</i>, Narcisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes</i>, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; gulped the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned back to catch the horse of the se&ntilde;orita for
you,&rdquo; observed Rhodes. &ldquo;It is best you tie him when you
lead him back, but first give him water. Thirst is perhaps
the cause he is restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; agreed the lad. &ldquo;At once I will do
that.&rdquo; But he held the horse and did not move from his
tracks, and then Rhodes noticed that on the flat rock
behind him was a grain sack thrown over something, a
brown bottle had rolled a little below it, and the end of
a hammer protruded from under the sacking.</p>
<p>Ordinarily Rhodes would have given no heed to any
simple ranch utensils gathered under the shadow where
work was more endurable, but the fear in the face of the
boy fascinated him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll give Pardner a drink while I am about it,&rdquo;
he decided, and dismounted carelessly. &ldquo;Got a cup that
I can take my share first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Narcisco had no cup, only shook his head and swallowed
as if the attempt at words was beyond him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is a bottle if it is clean,&rdquo; and Rhodes
strode awkwardly towards it, but his spur caught in the
loose mesh of the sacking, and in loosening it he twisted
it off the rock.</p>
<p>Narcisco gasped audibly, and Rhodes laughed. He had
uncovered a couple of dozen empty whiskey bottles, and
a tin pan with some broken glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you trying to start up here in the ca&ntilde;on,
Buddy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Playing saloon-keeper with only
the gophers for customers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He selected a corked bottle evidently clean, rinsed and
drank from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;I am here playing&ndash;&ndash;that is all,&rdquo; affirmed
Narcisco. &ldquo;At the house Tia Mariana puts us out
because there is a new <i>ni&ntilde;o</i>&ndash;&ndash;my mother and the new
one sleep&ndash;&ndash;and there is no place to make a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; commented Rhodes, &ldquo;well, let the black have
a little water, and lead him out of the way of mine. This
gully isn&rsquo;t wide enough to turn around in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently the boy led the black to the sunken barrel
catching seepage from the barrel under the drip. Rhodes
tossed the sack back to the flat rock and noted an old
canvas water bottle beside the heap, it was half full of
something&ndash;&ndash;not water, for it was uncorked and the
mouth of it a-glitter with shimmering particles like diamond
dust, and the same powder was over a white spot
on the rock&ndash;&ndash;the lad evidently was playing miller and
pounding broken glass into a semblance of meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny stunt, that!&rdquo; he pondered, and, smiling,
watched the frightened boy. &ldquo;Herrara certainly is doing
a bit of collecting <i>vino</i> to have a stock of bottles that
size, and the poor kid&rsquo;s nothing else to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mounted and rode on, leaving Narcisco to lead the
black to his mistress. He could not get out of his mind
the fright in the eyes of the boy. Was Herrara a brute
to his family, and had Narcisco taken to flight to hide
his simple playthings under the mistaken idea that the
horseman was his father returned early from the ranges?</p>
<p>That was the only solution Rhodes could find to the
problem, though he milled it around in his mind quite
a bit. Unless the boy was curiously weak-minded and
frightened at the face of a stranger it was the only explanation
he could find, yet the boys of Herrara had
always struck him as rather bright. In fact Conrad had
promoted Juanito to the position of special messenger;
he could ride like the wind and never forget a word.</p>
<p>The shadows lengthened as he circled the little ca&ntilde;on
of the Ojo Verde and noted the water dripping from the
full tanks, ideal for the colt range for three months. He
took note that Herrara was not neglecting anything,
despite that collection of bottles. There was no wastage
and the pipes connecting the tanks were in good condition.</p>
<p>He rode back, care free and content, through the fragrant
valley. The cool air was following the lowering
sun, and a thin mauve veil was drifting along the hills
of mystery in the south; he sang as he rode and then
checked the song to listen to the flutelike call of a lark.
His lips curved in a smile as he heard it, and with it came
the thought of the girl and the barred window of Vijil&rsquo;s
adobe.</p>
<p>She permeated the life of Granados just as the soft veil
enwrapped the far hills, and she had seemed almost as
far away if not so mysterious. Not once had he crossed
her trail, and he heard she was no longer permitted to
ride south of the line. The vaqueros commented on this
variously according to their own point of view. Some
of the Mexicans resented it, and in one way or another
her name was mentioned whenever problems of the future
were discussed. Singleton was regarded as temporary,
and Conrad was a salaried business manager. But on a
day to come, the se&ntilde;orita, as her mother&rsquo;s daughter, would
be their mistress, and the older men with families showed
content at the thought.</p>
<p>Rhodes never could think of her as the chatelaine of
those wide ranges. She was to him the &ldquo;meadow-lark
child&rdquo; of jests and laughter, heard and remembered but
not seen. She was the haunting music of youth meeting
him at the gateway of a new land which is yet so old!</p>
<p>Some such vagrant thought drifted through his mind
as the sweet calls of the drowsy birds cut the warm
silence, now from some graceful palo verde along a barranca
and again from the slender pedestal of an occotilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky you, for you get an answer!&rdquo; he thought
whimsically. &ldquo;Amble along, Pardner, or the night
witches get us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he circled a little at the north of the ca&ntilde;on,
and the black horse, champing and fidgeting, was held
there across the trail by its rider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing things in broad daylight, Pardner,
and there ain&rsquo;t no such animal,&rdquo; decided Rhodes, but
Pardner whinnied, and the girl threw up her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time I am a highwayman, the far-famed terror
of the ranges!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking quite a
while that your term must be about up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at that, and came alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you suppose I might have my time shortened
for good behavior?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You never even ride
our way to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Why, child, I&rsquo;m so busy absorbing <i>kultur</i> from
your scientific manager that my spare moments for damsels
in distress are none too plenty. You sent out nary
a call, and how expect the lowest of your serfs to hang
around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serf? That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; she said skeptically. &ldquo;And say,
you must love Conrad about as much as Cap Pike does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is like a rattlesnake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know that rattlesnake would be my first choice
of comparison,&rdquo; remarked Rhodes. &ldquo;Back in Tennessee
we have a variety beside which the rattlesnake is a
gentleman; a rattlesnake does his best to give warning of
intention, but the copperhead never does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copperhead! that&rsquo;s funny, for you know Conrad&rsquo;s
hair is just about the color of copper, dusty copper, faded
copper&ndash;&ndash;copper with tin filings sifted through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strain yourself,&rdquo; laughed Rhodes. &ldquo;That
beautiful blondness makes him mighty attractive to our
Mexican cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can have my share,&rdquo; decided the girl. &ldquo;I
could worry along without him quite awhile. He manages
to get rid of all the likeable range men <i>muy pronto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes laughed until she stared at him frowningly, and
then the delicious color swept over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i>!&rdquo; she said, and Rhodes thought of sweet
peas, and pink roses in old southern gardens as her lips
strove to be straight, yet curved deliciously. No one had
mentioned to him how pretty she was; he had thought of
her as a browned tom-boy, but instead she was a shell-pink
bud on a slender stem, and wonder of wonders&ndash;&ndash;she
rode a side-saddle in Arizona!</p>
<p>She noticed him looking at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to laugh at that, too?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me. It sort of looks
like home to me&ndash;&ndash;our southern girls use them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to him with a quick birdlike movement,
her gray eyes softened and trusting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s saddle, a wedding present from
the vaqueros of our ranches when she married my father.
I am only beginning to use it, and not so sure of myself
as with the one I learned on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You certainly
looked sure when you jumped that fence at Herrara&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at him quickly, curious, and then smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was you, not the meadow lark! You are too
clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t answer, just turned your back on the
lonely ranger,&rdquo; he stated dolefully, but she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look it, waiting to go home with you,&rdquo;
she retorted. &ldquo;Cap Pike has been telling me about you
until I feel as if I had known you forever. He says you
are his family now, so of course that makes Granados
different for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I&rsquo;ve been in sight of Granados as much as
twice since I struck this neck of the woods. Your manager
seems to think my valuable services are indispensable
at the southern side of this little world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the reason? I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said slowly.
&ldquo;One would have to be a seventh son of a seventh son
to understand his queer ways. But you are going along
home today, for I am a damsel in distress and need to
be escorted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look distressed, and I&rsquo;ve an idea you could
run away from your escort if you took a notion,&rdquo; he
returned. &ldquo;But it is my lucky day that I had a hunch
for this ca&ntilde;on trail and the Green Springs, and I am
happy to tag along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached Herrara&rsquo;s corral and Rhodes glanced
up the little gulch to the well. The flat rock there was
stripped of the odd collection, and Narcisco stood at the
corner of the adobe watching them somberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos tardes!</i>&rdquo; called the girl. &ldquo;Take care of the
<i>ni&ntilde;o</i> as the very treasure of your heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; agreed the lad, &ldquo;<i>Adios</i>, se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the special guard over the treasure?&rdquo; asked
Rhodes as their horses fell into the long easy lope side
by side. &ldquo;The house seems full and running over, and
<i>ni&ntilde;itas</i> to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are never any to spare,&rdquo; she reminded him,
&ldquo;and this one is doubly precious for it is named for me&ndash;&ndash;together
its saint and its two grandmothers! Benicia
promised me long ago that whether it was a boy or a girl
it would be Billie Bernard Herrara. I was just taking
the extra clothes I had Tia Luz make for him&ndash;&ndash;and he
is a little black-eyed darling! Soon as he is weaned I&rsquo;m
going to adopt him; I always did want a piccaninny for
my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes guided his horse carefully around a barranca
edge, honeycombed by gophers, and then let his eyes rest
again on the lustrous confiding eyes, and the rose-leaf
lips.</p>
<p>Afterward he told himself that was the moment he
began to be bewitched by Billie Bernard.</p>
<p>But what he really said was&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Shoo, child, you&rsquo;re
only a piccaninny yourself!&rdquo; and they both laughed.</p>
<p>It was quite wonderful how old Captain Pike had managed
to serve as a family foundation for their knowledge
of each other. There was not a doubt or a barrier between
them, they were &ldquo;home folks&rdquo; riding from different
ways and meeting in the desert, and silently claiming
kindred.</p>
<p>The shadows grew long and long under the sun of the
old Mexic land, and the high heavens blazed above in
yellows and pinks fading into veiled blues and far misty
lavenders in the hollows of the hills.</p>
<p>The girl drew a great breath of sheer delight as she
waved her hands towards the fire flame in the west where
the desert was a trail of golden glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am glad&ndash;&ndash;glad I got away!&rdquo; she said in a
hushed half-awed voice. &ldquo;It never&ndash;&ndash;never could be like
this twice and we are seeing it! Look at the moon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white circle in the east was showing through a net
of softest purple and the beauty of it caused them to
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it makes me want to sing, or to say my prayers,
or&ndash;&ndash;to cry!&rdquo; she said, and she blinked tears from her
eyes and smiled at him. &ldquo;I reckon the colors would look
the same from the veranda, but all this makes it seem
different,&rdquo; and her gesture took in the wide ranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it does,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;One wants to yell, &lsquo;Hurrah
for God!&rsquo; when a combination like this is spread before
the poor meek and lowly of the earth. It is a great stage
setting, and makes us humans seem rather inadequate.
Why, we can&rsquo;t even find the right words for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel that I just want to ride on and on,
and on through it, no matter which way I was headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take it from me, se&ntilde;orita, you are headed the
right way,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Going north is safe, but the
blue ranges of the south are walls of danger. The old
border line is a good landmark to tie to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;but all the fascinating things and
the witchy things, and the mysterious things are down
there over the border. I never get real joy riding north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because it is not forbidden, Miss Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they laughed again and lifted the bridles, and
the horses broke into a steady lope, neck and neck,
as the afterglow made the earth radiant and the young
faces reflected the glory of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that you said about getting away?&rdquo; he
queried. &ldquo;Did you break jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about. Papa Singleton hid my cross-saddle
thinking I would not go far on this one. They have put
a ban on my riding south, but I just had to see my Billie
Bernard Herrara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ran away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no. We sneaked away mighty slow and still till
we got a mile or two out, and then we certainly burned the
wind. Didn&rsquo;t we, Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as range boss of this end of the ranch I reckon
I have to herd you home, and tell them to put up the
fences,&rdquo; said Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will!&rdquo; she retorted in derision of this highly
improbable suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know! Singleton has good reasons
for restricting your little pleasure rides to Granados. Just
suppose El Gavilan, the Hawk, should cross your trail in
Sonora, take a fancy to Pat&ndash;&ndash;for Pat is some <i>caballo</i>!&ndash;&ndash;and
gather you in as camp cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; you can cook, can&rsquo;t you? All girls should
know how to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I do? I have cooked on the camp trips with
Cap Pike, but that doesn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll ever cook for that
wild rebel, Ramon Rotil. Are you trying to frighten me
off the ranges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only stating the case,&rdquo; replied Rhodes lighting a
cigarette and observing her while appearing not to.
&ldquo;Quite a few of the girls in the revolution camps are as
young as you, and many of them are not doing camp
work by their own choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, in time you would be ransomed, and for a
few minutes you might think it romantic&ndash;&ndash;the &lsquo;Bandit
Bride,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Rebel Queen,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Girl Guerrilla,&rsquo; and all
that sort of dope,&ndash;&ndash;but believe me, child, by the time the
ransom was paid you would be sure that north of the line
was the garden spot of the earth and heaven enough for
you, if you could only see it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him one sulky resentful look and dug her heel
into Pat. He leaped a length ahead of the roan and
started running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pretend you are El Gavilan after a lark, and
see how near you will get!&rdquo; she called derisively and
leaned forward urging the black to his best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You glorified gray-eyed lark!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Gather
her in, Pardner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he rode wide to the side instead of at the heels
of Pat and thus they rode neck and neck joyously while
he laughed at her intent to leave him behind.</p>
<p>The corrals and long hay ricks of Granados were now
in sight, backed by the avenue of palms and streaks of
green where the irrigation ditches led water to the outlying
fields and orchards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;El Gavilan!&rdquo; she called laughingly. &ldquo;Beat him, Pat,&ndash;&ndash;beat
him to the home gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out of a fork of the road to the left, an automobile
swept to them from a little valley, one man was driving
like the wind and another waved and shouted.
Rhodes&rsquo; eyes assured him that the shouting man was
Philip Singleton, and he rode closer to the girl, grasped
her bridle, and slowed down his own horse as well as
hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hate me some more for this,&rdquo; he stated as she
tried to jerk loose and failed, &ldquo;but that yelping windmill
is your fond guardian, and he probably thinks I am
trying to kidnap you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She halted at that, laughing and breathless, and waved
her hand to the occupants of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be good as an angel now that I have had my
day!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hello folks! What&rsquo;s the excitement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slender man whom Rhodes had termed the yelping
windmill, removed his goggles, and glared, hopelessly
distressed at the flushed, half-laughing girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billie&ndash;&ndash;Wilfreda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Papa Singleton! Don&rsquo;t swear, and don&rsquo;t
ever get frightened because I am out of sight.&rdquo; Then
she cast one withering glance at Rhodes, adding,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
if you engage range bosses like this one no one on
Granados will ever get out of sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire house force has been searching for you
over two hours. Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come along home to supper, and don&rsquo;t fuss,&rdquo; she
suggested. &ldquo;Just because you hid my other saddle I went
on a little <i>pasear</i> of my own, and I met up with this roan
on my way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes grinned at the way she eliminated the rider of
the roan horse, but the driver of the machine was not
deceived by the apparent slight. He had seen that half
defiant smile of comradeship, and his tone was not nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not good business to waste time and men in this
way,&rdquo; he stated flatly. &ldquo;It would be better that word is
left with the right ones when you go over the border to
amuse yourself in Sonora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile went out of the eyes of the girl, and she held
her head very erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Mr. Rhodes appear to agree perfectly, Mr.
Conrad,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;He was trying to show me
how little chance I would stand against El Gavilan or
even the Yaqui slave traders if they ranged up towards
the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slave traders?&rdquo; repeated Conrad. &ldquo;You are making
your jokes about that, of course, but the camp followers
of the revolution is a different thing;&ndash;&ndash;everywhere they
are ranging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer, and the car sped on to the
ranch house while the two horses cantered along after
them, but the joyous freedom of the ride had vanished,
lost back there on the ranges when the other minds met
them in a clash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; observed Rhodes, &ldquo;I said nothing about Yaqui
slave traders. Where did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Conrad and his man Brehman talking of the
profits,&ndash;&ndash;sixty pesos a head I think it was. I wonder
how they knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singleton was waiting for them at the entrance to the
ranch house, great adobe with a patio eighty feet square
in the center. In the old old days it had housed all the
vaqueros, but now the ranchmen were divided up on
different outlying rancherias and the many rooms of
Granados were mostly empty. Conrad, his secretary
Brehman, and their cook occupied one corner, while Singleton
and Billie and Tia Luz with her brood of helpers
occupied the other.</p>
<p>Singleton was not equal to the large hospitality of the
old days when the owner of a hacienda was a sort of
king, dispensing favors and duties to a small army of
retainers. A companionable individual he was glad to
meet and chat or smoke with, but if the property had been
his own he would have sold every acre and spent the proceeds
in some city of the East where a gentleman could
get something for his money.</p>
<p>Conrad had halted a moment after Singleton climbed
out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent word to Rhodes to come up from La Partida
because of the horse shipment,&rdquo; he said looking across
the level where the two riders were just entering the palm
avenue. &ldquo;Because of that it would seem he is to be
my guest, and I have room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we all have room, more room than anything
else,&rdquo; answered Singleton drearily, &ldquo;but it will be as
Billie says. I see Pike&rsquo;s nag here, and she always wants
Pike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The milky blue eyes of Conrad slanted towards Singleton
in discreet contempt of the man who allowed a wayward
girl to decide the guests or the housing of them.
But he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone will reach me if there is anything I
can do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Singleton did not reply. He knew Conrad absolutely
disapproved of the range boss being accepted as a family
guest. Between Billie and Captain Pike, who was a privileged
character, he did not quite see how he could prevent
it in the case of Rhodes, although he was honestly so
glad to see the girl ride home safe that he would have
accepted any guest of the range she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa Phil,&rdquo; she said smiling up into his face teasingly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my native heath again, so don&rsquo;t be sulky.
And I have a darling new namesake I&rsquo;ve been making
clothes for for a month, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about him if
you&rsquo;ll give Mr. Rhodes and me a good supper. He is
Cap Pike&rsquo;s family, and will have the south corner room;
please tell Tia Luz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when Billie was like that, and called him &ldquo;Papa
Phil,&rdquo; and looked up at him with limpid childish eyes,
there was never much else to be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show Rhodes his quarters myself, and you make
haste and get your habit off. Luz has been waiting supper
an hour. Today&rsquo;s paper reports a band of bandits running
off stock on the Alton ranch, and it is on the Arizona
side of the border. That should show you it is no time
to ride out of sight of the corrals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now! you know the paper raids aren&rsquo;t real
raids. They&rsquo;ll have a new one to get excited over tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran away to be petted and scolded and prayed
for by Tia Luz, who had been her nurse, and was now
housekeeper and the privileged one to whom Billie turned
for help and sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You laugh! but the heart was melting in me with the
fear,&rdquo; she grumbled as she fastened the yellow sash over
the white lawn into which Billie had dashed hurriedly.
&ldquo;It is not a joke to be caught in the raiding of Ramon
Rotil, or any of the other accursed! Who could think
it was south you were riding? I was the one to send them
north in the search, every man of them, and Se&ntilde;or Conrad
looks knives at me. That man thinks I am a liar, sure
he does! and the saints know I was honest and knew
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you know nothing, never could and never did,
you dear old bag of cotton,&rdquo; and Billie pinched affectionately
the fat arm of Tia Luz and tickled her under
her fat chin. &ldquo;Quick Luzita, and fasten me up. Supper
waits, and men are always raving wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught up a string of amber beads and clasped it
about her throat as she ran across the patio, and Kit
Rhodes halted a moment in the corridor to watch her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White and gold and heavenly lovely,&rdquo; he thought as
he rumpled his crisp brown curls meditatively, all forgetful
of the earnest attempts he had just made to smooth
them decorously with the aid of a damp towel and a
pocket comb. &ldquo;White and gold and a silver spoon, and a
back seat for you, Kittie boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pike emerged from a door at the corner of the
patio. He also had damp hair, a shiny face, and a brand-new
neckerchief with indigo circles on a white ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this, will you?&rdquo; he piped gleefully. &ldquo;Billie&rsquo;s
the greatest child ever! Always something stuck under
the pillow like you&rsquo;d hide candy for a kid, and say,&ndash;&ndash;if
any of the outfit would chuck another hombre in my bunk
the little lady would raise hell from here to Pinecate,
and worse than that there ain&rsquo;t any this side of the
European centers of civilization. Come on in, supper&rsquo;s
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes hesitated at the door of the dining room, suddenly
conscious of a dusty blouse and a much faded shirt.
His spurs clink-clanked as he strode along the tiling of
the patio, and in the semi-twilight he felt at home in the
ranch house, but one look at the soft glow of the shaded
lamps, and the foot deep of Mexican needlework on the
table cover, gave him a picture of home such as he had
not seen on the ranges.</p>
<p>Singleton was in spotless white linen, the ideal southern
ranchman&rsquo;s home garb, while the mistress of all the enticing
picture was in white and gold, and flushing pink
as she met the grave appreciative gaze of Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;lo little Santa Claus,&rdquo; chirruped Pike. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
the proper caper to set off my manly beauty, so I&rsquo;m one
ahead of Kit who has no one to garnish him for the feast&ndash;&ndash;and
it sure smells like some feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venison perhaps a trifle overdone, but we hope it
won&rsquo;t disappoint you,&rdquo; remarked Singleton. &ldquo;Have this
seat, Mr. Rhodes. Captain Pike and Miss Bernard always
chum together, and have their own side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; decided Pike, &ldquo;and that arrangement reaches
back beyond the memory of mere man in this outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; agreed the girl. &ldquo;Why, he used to
have to toss me over his head a certain number of times
before I would agree to be strapped in my high chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, and I carpentered the first one, and it wasn&rsquo;t so
bad at that! Now child, if you will pass the lemons, and
Kit will pass the decanter of amber, and someone else
will rustle some water, I&rsquo;ll manufacture a tonic to take
the dust out of your throats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody works but father,&rdquo; laughed Billie as the
Chinaman sliced and served the venison, and Tia Luz
helped supply all plates, and then took her place quietly
at the lower end of the table and poured the strong fragrant
coffee.</p>
<p>Rhodes spoke to her in Spanish, and her eyes lit up with
kindly appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, very good!&rdquo; she commented amicably. &ldquo;You
are not then too much Americano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I&rsquo;m about as American as you find them
aside from the Apache and Pima and the rest of the
tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but not gringo,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I am
scared of the Apache the same as of El Gavilan, and
today my heart was near to stop going at all when we lose
se&ntilde;orita and that black horse&ndash;&ndash;and I say a prayer for
you to San Antonio when I see you come fetch her home
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the black horse is valuable,&rdquo; remarked Billie.
&ldquo;Huh! I might as well be in a convent for all I get to
see of the ranges these late days. If anyone would grubstake
me, I&rsquo;d break loose with Cap here and go prospecting
for adventures into some of the unnamed ranges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; said Tia Luz. &ldquo;Is it a wonder I am cold
with the fear when she is away from my eyes? I have
lived to see the people who go into the desert for adventure,
and whose bare bones are all any man looks on
again! Beside the mountain wells of Carrizal my own
cousin&rsquo;s husband died; he could not climb to the tank
in the hill. There they found him in the moon of Kumaki,
which is gray and nothing growing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, many&rsquo;s the salt outfit in the West played out
before they reached Tinajas Altas,&rdquo; said Pike. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard curious tales about that place, and the Carrizals as
well. Billie&rsquo;s father nearly cashed in down in the Carrizals,
and one of his men did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is what I am saying. It was Dario Ruiz,&rdquo;
stated Tia Luz. &ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, that was the time, and it
was for the nameless ranges they went seeking, and for
adventures, treasure too; but&ndash;&ndash;his soul to God! it was
death Dario was finding on that trail. Your father never
would speak one word again of the treasure of that old
fable, for Dario found death instead of the red gold, and
Dario was <i>compadre</i> to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red gold?&rdquo; and Cap Pike&rsquo;s eyes were alight with
interest. &ldquo;Why, I was telling Kit about that today, the
red gold of El Alisal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or Capitan, once so rich and so red it was a
wonder in Spain when the padres are sending it there
from the mission of Soledad, and then witches craft, like
a cloud, come down and cover that mountain. So is the
vein lost again, and it is nearly one hundred years. So
how could Dario think to find it when the padres, with
all their prayer, never once found the trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard it was near a mission,&rdquo; remarked Pike.
&ldquo;Why, if it had a landmark like that there should be no
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it is so, and much trouble, also deaths,&rdquo; stated
Tia Luz. &ldquo;That is how the saying is that the red gold
of El Alisal is gold bewitched, for of Soledad not one
adobe is now above ground unless it be in the old walls of
the hacienda. All is melted into earth again or covered by
the ranch house, and it is said the ranch house is also
neglected now, and many of its old walls are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are still enough left to serve as a very fair
fortress,&rdquo; remarked Singleton. &ldquo;I was down there two
years ago when we bought some herds from Perez, and
lost quite a number from lack of water before the
vaqueros got them to La Partida wells. It is a long way
between water holes over in Altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Pike, &ldquo;but if the old mine was near a
mission, and the mission was near the ranch of Soledad
it should not be a great stunt to find it, and there must be
water and plenty of it if they do much in cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t these days,&rdquo; said Singleton. &ldquo;Perez sold
a lot rather than risk confiscation, and I heard they did
have some raids down there. I thought I had heard most
of the lost mine legends of western Sonora, but I never
heard of that one, and I never heard that Fred Bernard
went looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman lifted her brows and shrugged her
shoulders with the suggestion that Sonora might hold
many secrets from the amicable gentleman. But a little
later, in an inquiry from Rhodes she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you, se&ntilde;or, Dario Ruiz was <i>compadre</i> of Se&ntilde;or
Alfredo Bernard, Americanos not understanding all in
that word, and the grandfather of Dario was major-domo
of the rancho of Soledad at that time the Apaches
are going down and killing the people there. That is
when the mine was lost. On the skin of a sheep it was
told in writing all about it, and Dario had that skin.
Sure he had! It was old and had been buried in the sand,
and holes were eaten in it by wild things, but Don Alfredo
did read it, and I was hearing the reading of it to Dario
Ruiz, but of what use the reading when that mine bewitched
itself into hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the writing? Did that bewitch itself away also?&rdquo;
demanded Billie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I be asking of that when Dario was dead
down there in the desert, and his wife, that was my
cousin Anita, was crazy wild against Don Alfredo the
father of you! Ai, that was a bad time, and Don Alfredo
with black silence on him for very sorrow. And never
again in his life did he take the Sonora trail for adventures
or old treasure. And it is best that you keep to a
mind like his mind, se&ntilde;orita. He grew wise, but Dario
died for that wisdom, and in Sonora someone always
dies before wisdom is found. First it was two priests
went to death for that gold, and since that old day many
have been going. It is a witchcraft, and no blessing
on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon I&rsquo;d be willing to cross my fingers, and
take the trail if I could get started right,&rdquo; decided Rhodes.
&ldquo;It certainly sounds alluring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did go in once,&rdquo; confessed Pike, &ldquo;but we had no
luck, struck a <i>temporale</i> where a Papago had smallpox,
and two dry wells where there should have been water.
My working pardner weakened at Paradones and we
made tracks for the good old border. That is no trail for
a lone white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the writing, the writing!&rdquo; persisted Billie. &ldquo;Tia
Luz, you are a gold mine yourself of stories, but this
one you never told, and I am crazy about it! You never
forget anything, and the writing you <i>could</i> not,&ndash;&ndash;so we
know you have the very words of that writing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true too, for the words were not so many,
and where some words had been the wild things had
eaten holes. The words said that from the mine of El
Alisal the mission of Soledad could be seen. And from
the door of Soledad it was one look, one only, to the
blue ca&ntilde;oncita where the alisal tree was growing, and
water from the gold of the rose washed the roots of that
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; muttered Rhodes staring at the old lady
who sat nodding her head in emphasis until her jet and
gold earrings were all a-twinkle. &ldquo;It was as easy as <i>that</i>,&ndash;&ndash;yet
no one found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and it was plain to be seen that Do&ntilde;a
Luz was enjoying herself hugely as the center of all
attention, &ldquo;the two padres who made that writing met
their death at that place&ndash;&ndash;and it was said the <i>barbaros</i>
at last killed also the grandfather of Dario, anyway he
did die, and the women were afraid to tell even a new
padre of that buried writing for the cause that it must
have been accursed when it killed all people. That is how
it was, and that mission was forsaken after that time.
A Spaniard came up from Sinaloa and hunted gold and
built Soledad hacienda where that mission had been in
that old time, but no one ever found any more of gold
than the chickens always are picking, a little here, a little
there with a gravel in the craw. No se&ntilde;or, only once
the red gold&ndash;&ndash;red as flame&ndash;&ndash;went out of Altar on a
mule to the viceroy in Mexico, and the padres never lived
to send any more, or see their brothers again. The men
who dug that gold dug also their grave. Death goes
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; and Billie shivered slightly, and looked at
Rhodes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go digging it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes met hers across the table. It was only for an
instant, and then Billie got very busy with her coffee
which she had forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d travel with a mascot to ward off evil,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Would you give me a bead from your string?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, but did not speak. No one
noticed them, for Cap Pike was telling of the old native
superstition that the man who first found an ore bed found
no good luck for himself, though the next man might
make a fortune from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he continued in evidence, &ldquo;an Indian who finds
even a vein of special clay for pottery doesn&rsquo;t blaze a
trail to it for anyone else. He uses it if he wants it, because
his own special guardian god uncovered it for him,
but if it is meant for any other man, that other man&rsquo;s god
will lead him to it when the time comes. That is how they
reason it out for all the things covered by old Mother
Earth. And I reckon the redder the gold the more secret
the old <i>barbaros</i> would be about it, for gold is their sun-god
medicine, or symbol, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With white priests scattered through Sonora for two
centuries one would suppose those old superstitions would
be pretty well eradicated,&rdquo; remarked Singleton.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Luz glanced at him as at a child who must be let
have his own ideas so long as they were harmless, but
Pike laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love you, Singleton, nothing eradicates superstition
from the Indian mind, or any other mind! All
the creeds of the earth are built on it, and a lot of the
white ones are still alive and going strong! And as for
priests, why man, the Indian priests are bred of those
tribes, and were here before the white men came from
Spain. It&rsquo;s just about like this: If &lsquo;Me und Gott&rsquo; and
the U-boats took a notion to come over and put a ball
and chain on all of so-called free America, there might
be some pacifist mongrels pretend to like it, and just
dote on putting gilt on the chain, and kow-towing to that
blood-puddin&rsquo; gang who are raising hell in Belgium. But
would the thoroughbreds like it? Not on your life!
Well, don&rsquo;t you forget there were a lot of thoroughbreds
in the Indian clans even if some of their slaves did breed
mongrels! And don&rsquo;t forget that the ships from overseas
are dumping more scrub stock on the eastern shores right
now than you&rsquo;ll find in any Indian rancheria either here in
Pima or over in Sonora. The American isn&rsquo;t to blame
for all the seventeen dozen creeds they bring over,&ndash;&ndash;whether
political or religious, and I reckon that&rsquo;s about
the way the heads of the red clans feel. They are more
polite than we are about it, but don&rsquo;t you think for a
moment that the European invasion ever changed religion
for the Indian thoroughbred. No sir! He is still close
to the earth and the stars, and if he thinks they talk to
him&ndash;&ndash;well, they just <i>talk to him</i>, and what they tell him
isn&rsquo;t for you or me to hear,&ndash;&ndash;or to sit in judgment on
either, if it comes to that! We are the outsiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cap,&rdquo; said Billie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take it away.
It&rsquo;s too near your elbow, and you have had a double dose
for every single one you&rsquo;ve been handing out! You can
take a rest until the others catch up. Tia Luz, give him
a cup of coffee good and strong to help get his politics
and religion straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pike laughed heartily with the rest of them, and took
the coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear little Buttercup. Any medicine you
hand out is good to me. But say, that dope about hidden
ores may not be all Indian at that, for I recollect that
mountaineers of Tennessee had the same hunch about
coal veins, and an old lead vein where one family went
for their ammunition. They could use it and they did,
but were mighty sure they&rsquo;d all be hoodooed if they uncovered
it for anyone else, so I reckon that primitive
dope does go pretty far back. I&rsquo;ll bet it was old when
Tubal Cain first began scratching around the outcroppings
by his lonesomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conrad sauntered along the corridor and seated himself,
flicking idly some leather thongs he had cut out
from a green hide with a curved sheath knife rather fine
and foreign looking. Singleton called him to come in
and have coffee, but he would not enter, pleading his
evil-smelling pipe as a reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t beat mine for a downright bachelor equipment,&rdquo;
affirmed Pike, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve scandalized this outfit
enough, or thereabout, and that venison has killed all
our appetites until breakfast, so why hang around where
ungrateful children swat a man&rsquo;s dearest hobbies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;ll get rid of me that way you had
better think again,&rdquo; said Billie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your old
smokes, or any other of your evil ways, so long as you
and Tia Luz tell us more bewitched mine stories. Say,
Cap, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if that old sheepskin was found
again, and we&rsquo;d all outfit for a Sonora <i>pasear</i>, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not!&rdquo; decided the old man patting her
hair. &ldquo;You, my lady, will take a <i>pasear</i> to some highbrow
finishing school beyond the ranges, and I&rsquo;ll hit the
trail for Yuma in a day or two, but at the present moment
you can wind up the music box and start it warbling.
That supper sure was so perfect nothing but music will
do for a finish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men drifted out in the corridor and settled into
the built-in seats of the plazita, though Rhodes remained
standing in the portal facing inward to the patio where
the girl&rsquo;s shimmering white dress fluttered in the moonlight
beside the shadowy bulk of Tia Luz.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and listened for the music box Pike
had suggested, but instead he heard guitar strings, and
the little ripple of introduction to the old Spanish serenade
<i>Vengo a tu ventana</i>, &ldquo;I come to your window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and glanced towards the men who were
discussing horse shipments, and possibilities of the Prussian
sea raiders sinking transports on the way to France,
but decided his part of that discussion could wait until
morning.</p>
<p>Tia Luz had lit the lamp in the <i>sala</i>, and the light
streamed across the patio where the night moths fluttered
about the white oleanders. He smiled in comical self-derision
as he noticed the moths, but tossed away the
cigarette and followed the light.</p>
<p>When Captain Pike indulged the following morning in
sarcastic comment over Kit&rsquo;s defection, the latter only
laughed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shirk business? Nothing doing. I was strictly on
the job listening to local items on treasure trails instead
of powwowing with you all over the latest news reports
from the Balkans. Soon as my pocket has a jingle
again, I am to get to the French front if little old U.&nbsp;S.
won&rsquo;t give me a home uniform, but in the meantime
Do&ntilde;a Luz Moreno is some reporter if she is humored,
and I mean to camp alongside every chance I get. She
has the woman at the <i>cantina</i> backed off the map, and my
future Spanish lessons will be under the wing of Do&ntilde;a
Luz. Me for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avaricious young scalawag!&rdquo; grunted Pike. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
study African whistles and clicks and clacks if it blazed
trail to that lost gold deposit! Say, I sort of held the
others out there in front thinking I would let you get
acquainted with little Billie, and you waste the time
chinning about death in the desert, and dry camps to that
black-and-tan talking machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit only laughed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A record breaker of a moon too!&rdquo; grumbled the old
man. &ldquo;Lord!&ndash;&ndash;lord! at your age I&rsquo;d crawled over hell
on a rotten rail to just sit alongside a girl like Billie&ndash;&ndash;and
you pass her up for an old hen with a mustache, and
a gold trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes laughed some more as he got into the
saddle and headed for the Granados corral, singing:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Oh&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll cut off my long yellow hair<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>To dress in men&rsquo;s array,<br />
And go along with you, my dear<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Your waiting man to be!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>He droned out the doleful and incongruous love ballad
of old lands, and old days, for the absurd reason that the
youth of the world in his own land beat in his blood, and
because in the night time one of the twinkling stars of
heaven had dropped down the sky and become a girl of
earth who touched a guitar and taught him the words
of a Spanish serenade,&ndash;&ndash;in case he should find a Mexican
sweetheart along the border!</p>
<p>For to neither of the young, care-free things, had come
a glimmer of fore-vision of the long tragic days, treasure
trails and desert deaths, primitive devotions and
ungodly vengeance, in which the threads of their own
lives would be entangled before those two ever heard
the music of the patio again&ndash;&ndash;together.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>If in Holland fields I met a maid<br />

<br />

<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>That I would love her too,<br />
And I would step to the one side<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>That she might speak with you!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would&ndash;&ndash;not!&rdquo; he stated in practical prose
to no one in particular. &ldquo;Not if you were our girl, would
she, Pardner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pardner tossed up his head in recognition of the comradeship
in the tone, and Kit Rhodes became silent, and
rode on to the corrals, happily smiling at some new
thoughts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A VERIFIED PROPHECY OF SE&Ntilde;ORITA BILLIE</h3>
</div>
<p>That smile was yet with him when he saw the herd
and the vaqueros coming up from the water tanks,
and noted Conrad and Tomas Herrara talking together
beside Conrad&rsquo;s automobile.</p>
<p>The beat of the many hoofs prevented the two men
from noting one horse near them, and words of Conrad
came to him clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to be that way. You to go instead of Miguel.
You have enough English, you can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomas Herrara muttered something, evidently reluctance,
for again Conrad&rsquo;s words were heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the <i>dinero</i>, much of money to you!
And that fool swine will not see what is under his nose.
You can do it, sure you can! There is no danger. The
blame will be to him if it is found; my agent will see
to that. Not you but the gringo will be the one to answer
the law. You will know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in Spanish rapidly, while both men watched
the approaching vaqueros.</p>
<p>The smile had gone from Kit&rsquo;s face, and he was puzzled
to follow the words, or even trust his own ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno,</i>&rdquo; said Herrara with a nod of consent. &ldquo;Since
Miguel is hurt&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Pardner,&rdquo; sang out Rhodes, back of them
as he slid out of the saddle. &ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen.
Do you say Miguel is hurt, Herrara? How comes
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of Herrara went a curious gray, and his lips
blue and apparently stiff for he only murmured, &ldquo;<i>Buenas
dias</i>, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; and gulped and stared at Conrad. But
the surprise of Conrad, while apparent, was easily accounted
for, and he was too well poised to be startled
unduly by any emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! Is it you, Rhodes, so early? Yes, Miguel is
reported hurt over Poso Verde way. Not serious, but
for the fact that he was the one to go with you on the
horse shipment, and now another must go. Perhaps his
brother here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; assented Rhodes thoughtfully. He
was not so old as Conrad, and quite aware he was not
so clever, and he didn&rsquo;t know their game, so he strove
as he could to hold the meaning of what he had heard,
and ended rather lamely: &ldquo;Well, too bad about Miguel,
but if you, Tomas, are going instead, you had better get
your war togs ready. We start tonight from the Junction,
and have three hours to get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hours only!&rdquo; again Herrara seemed to
weaken. To start in three hours a journey into the unknown
far East of the Americano was beyond his imaginings.
He shrugged his shoulders, tossed his hands outwards
in despair, and turned toward the barns.</p>
<p>Conrad looked after him in irritation, and then smiled
at Rhodes. He had a rather ingratiating smile, and it
the first time he had betrayed it to Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These explosive Latins,&rdquo; he said derisively. &ldquo;I
think I can make him reasonable, and you go forward
with your own preparations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed Herrara, leaving Kit staring after them
wondering. His glance then rested on the automobile,
and he noted that it had not merely come out of the
garage for the usual work of the day. It had been traveling
somewhere, for the wheels were crusted with mud&ndash;&ndash;mud
not there at sunset yesterday. And in that section
of Pima there was no water to make mud nearer
than Poso Verde, and it was over there Miguel Herrara
had been hurt!</p>
<p>He had only three hours, and no time to investigate.
There were rumors of smuggling all along the line over
there, and strange conferences between Mexican statesmen
and sellers of Connecticut hardware of an explosive
nature. He recalled having heard that Singleton was
from Connecticut, or was it Massachusetts? Anyway,
it was over there at the eastern edge of the country somewhere,
and it was also where plots and counter plots were
pretty thick concerning ammunition; also they were more
complicated on the Mexican border. He wondered if
Singleton was as simple as he looked, for he certainly
was paying wages to a mixed lot. Also it was a cinch to
run any desirable contraband from Granados across to
La Partida and from there hellwards.</p>
<p>He wondered if Singleton knew? But Singleton had
a capable business manager, while he, Rhodes, was only
a range boss with the understanding that he adjust himself
to any work a white man might qualify for.</p>
<p>The mere fact that once he had sat at the family table
might not, in Singleton&rsquo;s eyes, warrant him in criticizing
an approved manager, or directing suspicion towards
him. He might speak to Pike, but he realized that Pike
was not taken very seriously; only welcomed because
Billie liked him, and because an American ranch usually
had the open door for the old timers of his caliber.</p>
<p>Also Pike had told him plainly that he must not be
expected to mix up in the Mexican game for any reason
whatsoever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s up to us, Pardner,&rdquo; he decided, as he
called directions to the different men loading the wagons
with oats and barley for the stock on the trail. There
were three mule teams ready for the railroad junction
where the cars were waiting on the siding, or would be
by night.</p>
<p>Some of the men were getting the mules straightened
out in the harness while others were roping horses in
the corral. It would take most of the home outfit to lead
and drive them to the railroad, which meant one lonely
and brief period of hilarity at the only joint where
&ldquo;bootleg&rdquo; whiskey could be secured by the knowing, and
a &ldquo;movie&rdquo; theater could add to other simple entertainments
for the gentle Juans of the ranges. Neither Conrad
nor Herrara were visible, and he presumed the latter
was making arrangements for the sudden and unexpected
departure from his family, but he knew he had not attempted
to ride home for a farewell greeting, because his
horse still stood near Conrad&rsquo;s automobile where he had
first overheard that curious conversation between the two
men.</p>
<p>After a leisurely breakfast Pike was meandering towards
the stock yard on his mule with the intent to trail
along to the Junction with the boys. Rhodes, catching
sight of him, looked hopefully but unsuccessfully for Singleton.
The minutes were slipping by, and no definite
instructions had been given him concerning the three
car loads of horses. Did Conrad mean to leave every
detail until the last moment and make difficulties for the
new man? Was that the way he got rid of the Americans
he didn&rsquo;t want? He recalled the prophecy of Billie
that he would not hold his job. Well, he would show
her!</p>
<p>With memories of the white and gold vision of the
previous night, and the guitar in the <i>sala</i>, and the moonlight
touching all to enchantment, he had fully decided
that he would not only hold the job, but on some future
day he would be business manager. And he&rsquo;d find that
lost mine or know the reason why, and he would&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>For after all Kit Rhodes was only twenty-three and
all of life ahead of him for dreams! He was wondering
what he could fetch back from the East that would
be acceptable to a witchy elf of a butterfly girl who already
had, to his simple estimate, all the requisites of a
princess royal.</p>
<p>Juanito came loping past, and Rhodes asked for his
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am myself looking for him,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;He has
there on his horse all the things for Tio Miguel, but
Miguel not coming, and I wonder who goes? Maybe it
will be me. What you think?&rdquo; he asked hopefully.</p>
<p>Kit did not answer, for Juanito&rsquo;s mention of the articles
for Miguel brought from home by Tomas, and still
fastened to the back of the saddle, drew his attention to
the articles tied there&ndash;&ndash;some clothing badly wrapped, a
pair of black shoes tied together with brown strings,
and under them, yet plainly visible, a canvas water bag.</p>
<p>There was nothing unusual in a water bag or a canteen
tied back of any saddle in the dry lands, it was the
sensible thing to do, but Kit found himself staring at this
particular water bag stupidly, remembering where he had
seen it last. It had been only partly full then, but now
it was plump and round as if water-filled; yet one glance
told him it was not wet, and moreover, he had noted the
day before a hole in the side tied up in a hard knot by
twine, and there was the knot!</p>
<p>Yet it might be a stock of <i>pinole</i>, parched corn, as evidence
of Miguel&rsquo;s forethought against privation on the
long eastern trail. He could think of several reasonable
things to account for an old water bag tied to a Mexican&rsquo;s
saddle, but reason did not prevent his glance turning
to it again and again.</p>
<p>The fear in Narcisco&rsquo;s eyes came back to him, and his
attempt to cover his harmless playthings at the coming
of the unexpected American. He wondered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bub, I&rsquo;ve got ten dollars to invest in some little
trinket for Billie boy, and I want you to put it down in
your jeans and invest it in whatever it will cover,&rdquo; said
Captain Pike at his elbow, clinking the silver coin meditatively.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have time to see plenty attractive things
for the money there in the streets of New York, or Baltimore,
or whichever of the dock towns you&rsquo;ll be heading
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes accepted the coin, absently frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the dark secrets not yet divulged by
this curious management,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to go, or
so I was told, but have been given no instructions.
Where&rsquo;s Singleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just rounded up for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming down here to the corrals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I could notice. Pedro got in from the Junction
with last Sunday&rsquo;s papers, and he and Billie have the
picture sheets spread around, having a weekly feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit strode over to his mount, and then halted, glancing
towards the house a half mile away, and then at the
telephone poles along the wide lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s a telephone somewhere down here at
the works, connecting with the hacienda, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, in that hallway between the two adobes where
the bunk house ends and offices begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit started briskly towards the long bunk house, and
then turned to Pike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do me a favor, Captain. Stay right there till I get
back, and don&rsquo;t let anyone take that Herrara horse away,
or his load!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but load!&ndash;&ndash;why, the spotted rat hasn&rsquo;t
got a load for a jack rabbit, load!&rdquo; and Pike sniffed disdain
at the little knobs of baggage dangling from the
rawhide strings. He didn&rsquo;t think the subdued animal
needed watching&ndash;&ndash;still, if Kit said so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>At the same time Kit was calling the house, and hearing
in reply a soft whistle of the meadow lark, and then
a girl&rsquo;s laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your music is good to listen to, Lark-child,&rdquo; he
called back, &ldquo;and your ears are perfectly good at telling
who&rsquo;s who, but this is a strictly business day, and it is
Mr. Singleton I need to speak with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still holding your job, or asking for your time?&rdquo;
came the mocking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m holding my job, also I am on it, and
want the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sometimes you know the boys call me the
boss. What can we do for you, Mr. Kit Rhodes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use all three of my Spanish cuss words in a
minute, if you don&rsquo;t be reasonable,&rdquo; he thundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a bribe?&rdquo; came sweetly over the wire, and
when he muttered something impatiently, she laughed and
told him it was not fair to use another language when he
had promised Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, young lady, if I can&rsquo;t get Singleton on
the wire I&rsquo;ll get on a horse and go up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you listen to me, young man, it wouldn&rsquo;t do you
a bit of good, for just now he is nearly having a fit, and
writing telegrams about something more important than
the horse corrals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more important this day and date,&rdquo;
insisted Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you were as strictly a white dove advocate
as Papa Singleton is, and as neutral, and then saw a full
page Sunday supplement of your pet picture fraulein,
working for your pet charity and sifting poison into hospital
bandages and powdered glass in jellies for the soldiers
of the Allies, I reckon you would change your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powdered glass!&ndash;&ndash;in <i>feed</i>!&rdquo; repeated Kit, stunned at
the words and the sudden thought they suggested. &ldquo;Great
God, girl, you don&rsquo;t have to go to the eastern papers for
<i>that</i>! You&rsquo;ve got the same trick right here in Granados
this minute! Why&ndash;&ndash;damn you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receiver fell from his hand as a crushing blow was
dealt him from the door at his back. He heard a girl&rsquo;s
scream in the distance as he grappled with Conrad and
saved himself a second blow from the automobile wrench
in the manager&rsquo;s hands. It fell to the tiles between them,
and Rhodes kicked it to one side as he struck and struck
again the white, furious face of Conrad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wrench! Tomas, the wrench! Give it to him!
The Americano would murder me!&rdquo; shouted Conrad.</p>
<p>Tomas had other things to think of. He had heard
as much as Conrad of the telephone discourse, and was
aware of his pinto standing placidly not fifty feet away,
with all the damning evidence in the case tied to the back
of the saddle!</p>
<p>Juanito, however, ran like a cat at his master&rsquo;s call
and caught up the wrench, but halted when Pike closed
on his shoulder and pressed a cold little circle of blue
steel against his ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time, <i>muchacho</i>!&rdquo; he shrilled, &ldquo;drop it!
This is a man&rsquo;s game, and you&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men came running, and others attempted to interfere,
but the little old man waved the gun at them and
ordered them to keep their distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No crowding the mourners!&rdquo; he admonished them
gleefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a hunch your man started it, and my
man will finish it. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s about, Kit, but
give him hell on suspicion! Go to it, boy,&ndash;&ndash;do it again!
Who-ee!&ndash;&ndash;that was a sock-dolager! Keep him off you,
Kit, he&rsquo;s a gouger, and has the weight. Give it to him
standing, and give it to him good! That&rsquo;s it! Ki-yi!
Hell&rsquo;s bells and them a-chiming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the finale of that whirl of the two striking, staggering,
cursing men, was unexpectedly dramatic. They
had surged out into the open, but Conrad, little by little
and step by step, or rather stagger by stagger, had given
way before the mallet-like precision of the younger man&rsquo;s
fists until Kit&rsquo;s final blow seemed actually to lift him off
his feet and land him&ndash;&ndash;standing&ndash;&ndash;against the adobe
wall. An instant he quivered there, and then fell forward,
glassy eyed and limp.</p>
<p>Singleton&rsquo;s car came whirling down the lane. Billie
leaped from it before it stopped, and ran in horror to
the prone figure. One of the older Mexicans tried to
ward her off from the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good, se&ntilde;orita, it is the death of him,&rdquo; he said
gently. &ldquo;One stroke like that on the heart and it is&ndash;&ndash;<i>adios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of God&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Singleton, and
Kit wiped the blood from his eyes and faced him, staggering
and breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him water! Get busy!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;s done for, not unless he has some mighty weak
spot he should have had labelled before he waded into
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood was still trickling from the cut in his head
made by the wrench, and he presented an unholy appearance
as they stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain, Singleton, for I reckon you are white.
I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;after while&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll explain nothing to me!&rdquo; retorted Singleton
&ldquo;If the man dies you&rsquo;ll explain to a jury and a judge;
otherwise you&rsquo;d better take yourself out of this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit blinked at those who were lifting Conrad and
listening to his heart, which evidently had not stopped
permanently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But give me a chance, man!&rdquo; persisted Rhodes. &ldquo;I
need some mending done on this head of mine,&ndash;&ndash;then
I&rsquo;ll clear it up. Why, the evidence is right here&ndash;&ndash;powdered
glass for the stock at the far end of the trail&ndash;&ndash;Herrara
knows&ndash;&ndash;Conrad&rsquo;s game&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know why words were difficult and the
faces moved in circles about him. The blood soaking his
shirt and blouse, and dripping off his sleeve was cause
enough, but he did not even know that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away, Captain Pike,&rdquo; said Singleton coldly.
&ldquo;He is not wanted any longer on either of the ranches.
It&rsquo;s the last man I hire, Conrad can do it in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad, eh?&rdquo; grunted Kit weakly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a nice
easy mark for the frankfurter game,&ndash;&ndash;you and your
pacifist bunch of near-traitors! Why man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Singleton waved him away, and followed the
men who were carrying Conrad to the bunk house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, <i>all</i> right! But take care you don&rsquo;t meet
with a nastier accident than that before you are done with
this game!&rdquo; he said shaking his fist warningly after Singleton,
and then he staggered to his horse where Pike was
waiting for him.</p>
<p>He got in the saddle, and reeled there a moment, conscious
of hostile, watchful eyes,&ndash;&ndash;and one girl&rsquo;s face all
alone in the blur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I heard you scream. You thought
it was you I swore at. You&rsquo;re wrong there. But you
are some little prophetess,&ndash;&ndash;<i>you</i> are! The job&rsquo;s gone,
and Herrara&rsquo;s got away with the evidence, and the jig&rsquo;s
up! But it wasn&rsquo;t you I cussed at&ndash;&ndash;not&ndash;&ndash;at&ndash;&ndash;all!
Come on, Pike. This new ventilator in my head is playing
hell its own way. Come on&ndash;&ndash;let&rsquo;s go by-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>IN THE ADOBE OF PEDRO VIJIL</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such animal,&rdquo; decided Kit Rhodes
seated on the edge of the bed in Pedro Vigil&rsquo;s
adobe. His head was bandaged, his face a trifle pale and
the odor of medicaments in the shadowy room of the
one deep-barred window. &ldquo;No, Captain, no man, free,
white and twenty-one <i>could</i> be such a fool. Can&rsquo;t Singleton
see that if Conrad&rsquo;s story was true he&rsquo;d have the
constable after me for assault with intent to kill? He&rsquo;s
that sort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Singleton thinks Conrad would be justified in
having you prosecuted, and jailed, and fined, and a few
other things, but for the reputation of Granados they let
you down easy. You know it&rsquo;s <i>the</i> dovery for the Pass-up-the-fists
of this section, and what the Arizona papers
would do would be comic if they ever got hold of the
fact that Singleton picked a new bird for the dove cage,
and the dratted thing changed before their eyes to a
fractious game rooster swinging a right like the hind leg
of a mule! No, Bub, we&rsquo;re orderly, peaceable folks
around here, so for the sake of our reputation Singleton
has prevailed on his manager to be merciful to you,
and Conrad has in true pacifist spirit let himself be prevailed
upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; grinned Kit, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m to be put off
my guard, and done for nicely and quietly some moonless
night when I take the trail! And he reports me either
drunk or temporarily insane, does he? Well, when the
next time comes I&rsquo;ll change that gentleman&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, Bub! Thank a fool&rsquo;s luck that your skull
was only scratched, and don&rsquo;t go planning future wars.
I tell you we are peace doves around here, and you are
a stray broncho kicking up an undesirable dust in our
front yard. Here is your coin. Singleton turned it over
to me and I receipted for it, and we have enough between
us to hit the Sonora trail, and there&rsquo;s not a bit of use
in your hanging around here. You have no evidence.
You are a stranger who ambled in, heard a sensational
newspaper report of anti-ally criminal intent, and on the
spot accused the highly respectable Granados rancho of
indulging in that same variety of hellishness! Now there
is your case in a nutshell, Bub, and you wouldn&rsquo;t get the
authorities to believe you in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have just little enough sense to believe your
hunch is right, but that won&rsquo;t get you anywhere. They
think I&rsquo;m loco too! I&rsquo;ve an idea there is a lot more and
rottener activities down south of the line with which our
Teutonic peace arbitrator is mixed up. But he&rsquo;s been on
this job five years, all the trails are his, and an outsider
can&rsquo;t get a look-in! Now Miguel Herrara has been doing
gun-running across the border for someone, and
Miguel was not only arrested by the customs officer, but
Miguel was killed two nights ago&ndash;&ndash;shot with his own
gun so that it looks like suicide. Suicide nothing! His
chief, whoever he is, was afraid Miguel would blunder
or weaken under government persuasion, so Miguel was
let out of the game. That case is closed, and no evidence
against anyone. I reckon everyone knows that the guns
and ammunition sneaked over is headed for Rancho Soledad.
The owner of Soledad, Jos&eacute; Perez, is the valued
friend of our nice little Conrad, and it happens that Conrad
left Granados this morning for that direction, ostensibly
to negotiate with the political powers of Sonora
concerning a military guard for La Partida in case revolutionary
stragglers should ride north for fresh saddle-horses.
All appeals to the neutral chair warmers at
Washington wins us no protection from that source;&ndash;&ndash;they
only have guns and men enough to guard some
cherished spots in Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the Teuton is able for a trail I reckon he
got nothing worse in the scrap than I, even if he did look
like a job for the undertaker. That fellow travels on the
strength of his belly and not the strength of his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; observed Pike, grinning, &ldquo;but then again
there are others of us who travel on nerve and gall and
never get any further! Just put this in your pipe, Bub,
and don&rsquo;t forget it: Conrad is <i>organised</i> for whatever
deviltry he is up to! There is no &lsquo;happen so&rsquo; in his
schemes. He is a cog in some political wheel, and it&rsquo;s a
fifty-fifty gamble as to whether the wheel is German or
Mexican, but it is no little thing, and is not to be despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see how Singleton, if Singleton is square
even&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singleton is a narrow gauge disciple of Universal
Peace by decree&ndash;&ndash;which, translated, means plain damn
fool. Lord, boy, if a pack of prairie wolves had a man
surrounded, would he fold his hands with the hope that
his peaceful attitude would appeal to their better instincts
or would he reach for a gun and give them protective
pills? The man of sense never goes without his gun in
wolf land, but Singleton&ndash;&ndash;well, in peace times he could
have lived a long lifetime, and no one ever guessed what
a weak sister he was, but he&rsquo;s sure out of place on the
border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired wearing this halo,&rdquo; observed Rhodes, referring
to the white handkerchief around his head. &ldquo;Also
some of the dope you gave me seems to be evaporating
from my system, and I feel like hitting the Piman breeze.
Can we strike trail tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot. Do&ntilde;a Luz has been dosing out the
dope for you&ndash;&ndash;Mexican women are natural doctors with
their own sort of herbs&ndash;&ndash;and she says three days before
you go in the sun. I&rsquo;ve a notion she sort of let the Mexicans
think that you were likely to cash in, and you bled
so like a stuck pig that it was easy enough to believe the
worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s why Conrad felt safe in leaving me
outside of jail. With Do&ntilde;a Luz as doctor, and a non-professional
like you as assistant, I reckon he thought
my chance of surviving that monkey wrench assault was
slim, mighty slim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; agreed Pike, &ldquo;under ordinary conditions
he might have been justified in such surmise, but that
would be figuring on the normal thickness of the normal
civilized skull, but yours&ndash;&ndash;why, Bub, all I&rsquo;m puzzling
over now is how it happens that the monkey wrench was
only twisted a mite, not broke at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scandalous old varmint!&rdquo; grinned Kit. &ldquo;Go on
with your weak-minded amusements, taking advantage
of a poor lone cripple,&ndash;&ndash;refused by the army, and a victim
of the latest German atrocity! I suppose&ndash;&ndash;I suppose,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
continued darkly, &ldquo;everyone on and around Granados
agrees that I was the villain in the assault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say as to that,&rdquo; returned Pike judicially.
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Luz would dose you, and plaster you, just the
same if you had killed a half dozen instead of knocking
the wind out of one. She&rsquo;s pretty fine and all woman,
but naturally since they regard you as my <i>companero</i> they
are shy about expressing themselves when I&rsquo;m around&ndash;&ndash;all
except Singleton&ndash;&ndash;and you heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good and plenty,&rdquo; agreed Kit. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m going to
catch up on sleep while I&rsquo;ve a chance, and you rustle
along and get any tag ends of things needed for the trail.
I&rsquo;m going to strike for Mesa Blanca, as that will take us
up into the country of that Alisal mine. If we go broke
there is Mesa Blanca ranch work to fall back on for a
grub stake, but from what I hear we can dry wash enough
to buy corn and flour, and the hills are full of burro meat.
We&rsquo;ll browse around until we either strike it rich, or get
fed up with trying. Anyway, <i>Companero</i>, we will be in
a quiet, peaceful pastoral land, close to nature, and out
of reach of Teuton guile and monkey wrenches. <i>Buenas
noches</i>, se&ntilde;or. I&rsquo;m asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pike closed the door, and went from the semi-dark of
the adobe out into the brilliant sunshine where Billie,
with a basket, was waiting under the <i>ramada</i> with
Merced, and Merced looked gloomy lest Pedro should be
blamed by Se&ntilde;or Singleton for practically turning his
family out of the adobe that it might be given over to
the loco Americano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, can he go?&rdquo; she asked hopefully. &ldquo;Me,
I have a fear. Not before is the adobe here watched by
hidden men at night, and that is very bad! Because that
he is friend to you I say to everybody that I think the
Americano is dying in our house, but today he talks,
also he is laughing. No more sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more sick, sure not, but it will be one more day.
A man does not bleed like a gored bull and ride the next
day under a sky hot enough to fry eggs. The tea of
Do&ntilde;a Luz drove off the fever, and he only sleeps and
talks, and sleeps again, but sick? Not a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor&ndash;&ndash;nor sorry, I reckon?&rdquo; ventured Billie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no child, not that I could notice. That scalawag
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much conscience concerning his
behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or his language!&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that was some invocation he offered up! But
just between pals, Billie, you ought to have been in hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t suppose he even remembers that I was,&rdquo;
she remarked, and then after a silence, &ldquo;or&ndash;&ndash;or even
mentioned&ndash;&ndash;us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Billie. You made the right guess when you
sized him up and thought he couldn&rsquo;t hold the job. He
certainly doesn&rsquo;t belong, Billie, for this ranch is the homing
nest of the peace doves, and he&rsquo;s just an ungainly
young game rooster starting out with a dare against the
world, and only himself for a backer. Honest,&ndash;&ndash;if that
misguided youth had been landed in jail, I don&rsquo;t reckon
there&rsquo;s anyone in Arizona with little enough sense to bail
him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely not,&rdquo; said Billie. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the basket
from Tia Luz, and I might as well go home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AN &ldquo;ADIOS&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;AND AFTER</h3>
</div>
<p>Two days later in the blue clear air of the Arizona
morning a sage hen slipped with her young through
the coarse grass by the irrigation ditch, and a flock of
quail raised and fluttered before the quick rhythmic beat
of a loping horse along the trail in the mesquite thicket.</p>
<p>The slender gallant figure of his rider leaned forward
looking, listening at every turn, and at the forks of the
trail where a clump of squat mesquite and giant sahuarro
made a screen, she checked the horse, and held her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Pat, good horse!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got nothing that can run away from us. We&rsquo;ll show
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a man&rsquo;s quavering old voice came to her through
the winding trail of the arroya. It was lifted tunefully
insistent in an old-time song of the mining camps:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Oh, Mexico! we&rsquo;re coming, Mexico!<br />
Our six mule team,<br />
Will soon be seen,<br />
On the trail to Mexico!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;We made it, Pat!&rdquo; confided the girl grimly. &ldquo;We
made it. Quiet now&ndash;&ndash;quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She peered out through the green mesquite as Captain
Pike emerged from the west arroya on a gray burro,
herding two other pack animals ahead of him into the
south trail.</p>
<p>He rode jauntily, his old sombrero at a rakish angle,
his eyes bright with enthusiasm supplied by that which
he designated as a morning &ldquo;bracer,&rdquo; and his long gray
locks bobbed in the breeze as he swayed in the saddle and
droned his cheerful epic of the trail:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>A&ndash;&ndash;and when we&rsquo;ve been there long enough,<br />
And back we wish to go,<br />
We&rsquo;ll fill our pockets with the shining dust<br />
And then leave Mexico!<br />
Oh&ndash;&ndash;Mexico!<br />
Good-bye my Mexico!<br />
Our six mule team will then be seen<br />
On the trail from Mexico.</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there! you Balaam&ndash;&ndash;get into the road and keep
a-going, you ornery little rat-tailed son-of-a-gun! Pick
up your feet and travel, or I&rsquo;ll yank out your back bone
and make a quirt out of it! For&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>My name was Captain Kidd as I sailed<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>As I sailed,<br />

My name was Captain Kidd<br />
And most wickedly I di-i-id<br />
All holy laws forbid<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>As I sailed!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The confessor of superlative wickedness droned his
avowal in diminishing volume as the burros pattered
along the white dust of the valley road, then the curve
to the west hid them, and all was silence but for the rustle
of the wind in the mesquite and the far bay of Singleton&rsquo;s
hounds circling a coyote.</p>
<p>But Pat pricked up his ears, and lifted his head as if
feeling rather than hearing the growing thud of coming
hoofs. The girl waited until they were within fifty feet,
when she pursed up her lips and whistled the call of the
meadow lark. It sounded like a fairy bugle call across
the morning, and the roan was halted quickly at the
forks of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
you, but your song beats the birds. Got a flag of truce?
Willing to parley with the enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she emerged, eyeing him sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going without seeing me!&rdquo; she stated with
directness, and without notice of the quizzical smile of
comradeship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly was,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;When I got through
the scrap with your disciple of <i>kultur</i>, my mug didn&rsquo;t
strike me as the right decoration for a maiden&rsquo;s bower.
I rode out of the scrap with my scratches, taking joy
and comfort in the fact that he had to be carried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no reason for your being so&ndash;&ndash;so brutal!&rdquo;
she decided austerely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love you, child, I didn&rsquo;t need a reason&ndash;&ndash;I only
wanted an excuse. Give me credit! I got away for
fear I&rsquo;d go loco and smash Singleton for interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa Phil only did his duty, standing for peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, let the Neutral League do it! The trouble with
Singleton is he hasn&rsquo;t brains enough to lubricate a balance
wheel,&ndash;&ndash;he can&rsquo;t savvy a situation unless he has it printed
in a large-type tract. Conrad was scared for fear I&rsquo;d
stumbled on a crooked trail of his and would tell the
boss, so he beat me to it with the lurid report that I
made an assault on him! This looks like it&ndash;&ndash;not!&rdquo;
and he showed the slashes in his sombrero to make room
for the blue banda around his head. &ldquo;Suppose you tell
that Hun of yours to carry a gun like a real hombre instead
of the tools of a second-story man. The neighbors
could hear a gun, and run to my rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl regarded his flippancy with disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t my Hun,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I could worry
along without him on our map,&ndash;&ndash;but after all, I don&rsquo;t
know a single definite thing against him. Anyway, it&rsquo;s
decided I&rsquo;ve got to go away somewhere to school and be
out of the ranch squabbles. Papa Phil thinks I get in
bad company out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he <i>said</i> Captain Pike was demoralizing to the
youthful mind. He didn&rsquo;t mention you. And Cap certainly
did go the limit yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he went to the Junction for his outfit stuff&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and never showed up at the adobe until the
morning star was in the sky!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;You poor kid, you have a hard time with the disreputables you pick up.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I went with him. We
stayed to see a Hart picture at the theater, and had the
time of our young lives. At supper I announced that I
was going to adopt Cap as a grandfather,&ndash;&ndash;and then of
course he had to go and queer me by filling up on some
rank whiskey he had smuggled in with the other food!
My stars!&ndash;&ndash;he was put to bed singing that he&rsquo;d &lsquo;Hang his
harp on a willow tree, and be off to the wars again&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;You
needn&rsquo;t laugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did laugh, his blue eyes twinkling at her recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor kid! You have a hard time with the disreputables
you pick up. Sure they didn&rsquo;t warn you
against speaking to this reprobate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure nothing!&rdquo; was the boyish reply. &ldquo;I was to be
docked a month&rsquo;s spending money if I dared go near
Pedro Vijil&rsquo;s adobe again while you were there, which
was very foolish of Papa Phil!&rdquo; she added judicially.
&ldquo;I reckon he forgot they tried that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down and borrowed double the amount from
old Estevan, the trader at the Junction, and gave him an
order against the ranch. Then Cap and I sneaked out
a couple of three-year-olds and raced them down in the
cottonwood flats against some colts brought down by an
old Sierra Blanca Apache. We backed our nags with
every peso, and that old brown murderer won! But Cap
and I had a wonderful day while our coin lasted, and&ndash;&ndash;and
you were going away without saying good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes, who had blankly stated that he owned his
horse and saddle and little beyond, looked at the spoiled
plucky heiress of Granados ranches, and the laughter
went out of his eyes.</p>
<p>She was beyond reason loveable even in her boyish
disdain of restriction, and some day she would come
back from the schools a very finished product, and thank
the powers that be for having sent her out of knowledge
of happy-go-lucky chums of the ranges.</p>
<p>Granados ranches had been originally an old Spanish
grant reaching from a branch of the intermittent Rio
Altar north into what is now Arizona, and originally
was about double the size of Rhode Island. It was
roughly divided into the home or hacienda ranch in
Arizona, and La Partida, the cattle range portion, reaching
far south into Sonora. Even the remnant of the
grant, if intelligently managed, would earn an income
satisfactory for a most extravagant princess royal such
as its present chatelaine seemed to Rhodes.</p>
<p>But he had noted dubiously that the management was
neither intelligent nor, he feared, square. The little
rancherias scattered over it in the fertile valleys, were
worked on the scratch gravel, ineffective Mexic method
by the Juans and Pedros whose family could always
count on mesquite beans, and <i>camotes</i> if the fields failed.
There was seed to buy each year instead of raising it.
There was money invested in farming machinery, and a
bolt taken at will from a thresher to mend a plow or
a buggy as temporarily required. The flocks of sheep on
the Arizona hills were low grade. The cattle and horse
outfits were south in La Partida, and the leakage was
beyond reason, even in a danger zone of the border land.</p>
<p>All this Kit had milled around and around many times
in the brief while he had ranged La Partida. A new deal
was needed and needed badly, else Wilfreda Bernard
would have debts instead of revenue if Singleton let
things drift much longer. Her impish jest that she was
a damsel in distress in need of a valiant knight was
nearer to truth than she suspected. He had an idiotic
hungry desire to be that knight, but his equipment of one
horse, one saddle, and one sore head appeared inadequate
for the office.</p>
<p>Thus Kit Rhodes sat his horse and looked at her, and
saw things other than the red lips of the girl, and the
chiding gray eyes, and the frank regret at his going.</p>
<p>It was more profitable not to see that regret, or let it
thrill a man in that sweet warm way, especially not if the
man chanced to be a drifting ranger. She was only a
gallant little girl with a genius for friendships, and her
loyalty to Pike extended to Pike&rsquo;s chum&ndash;&ndash;that was what
Rhodes told himself!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;I was going without any tooting
of horns. No use in Cap Pike and me hanging around,
and getting you in bad with your outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I care!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might some day,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;School may
make a lot of difference; that, and changed surroundings
for a year or two. But some day you will be your own
manager, and if I&rsquo;m still on the footstool and can be of
service&ndash;&ndash;just whistle, se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; she agreed cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll whistle the lark
call, and you&rsquo;ll know I need you, so that&rsquo;s settled, and
we&rsquo;ll always be&ndash;&ndash;be friends, Trail-hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always be friends, Lark-child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted Cap Pike to let me in on this prospecting
trip, wanted to put in money,&rdquo; she said rather hesitant,
&ldquo;and he turned me down cold, except for a measly ten
dollars, &lsquo;smoke money&rsquo; he called it. I reckon he only
took that to get rid of me, which I don&rsquo;t call friendly,
do you? And if things should go crooked with him,
and he&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;sort of needs help to get out, you&rsquo;ll let
me know, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it seems best,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t
be here; you&rsquo;ll be shipped to a school, <i>pronto</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be so far off the map that a letter can&rsquo;t reach
me. Cap Pike won&rsquo;t ever write, but I thought maybe
you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Rhodes easily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send out a
long yell for help whenever we get stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She eyed him darkly and without faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew how to make that certain,&rdquo; she confessed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only dodging me with any kind of a
promise to keep me quiet, just as Cap did. I know! I&rsquo;m
jealous, too, because you&rsquo;re taking a trail I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to take with Cap, and they won&rsquo;t let me because
I&rsquo;m a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up! When you are boss of the range you can
outfit any little <i>pasear</i> you want to take, but you and I
won&rsquo;t be in the same class then, Lark-child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really going it blind, trailing with Cap into
the Painted Hills after that fascinating gold legend?&rdquo;
she demanded. &ldquo;Or have you some inside trail blazed
for yourself? Daddy Pike is the best ever, but he always
goes broke, and if he isn&rsquo;t broke, he has a jug at his
saddle horn, so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s only a little jug this time, and he&rsquo;s had a fare-you-well
drink out of it with everyone in sight, so there&rsquo;s
only one hilarious evening left in the jug now. Just
enough for a gladsome memory of civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in deep on this prospect plan?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not that you could notice. That is, I&rsquo;ve got a
three months&rsquo; job offered me down at Whitely&rsquo;s; that will
serve the captain as headquarters to range from until
we add to our stake. Whitely is rounding up stock for
the Allies down Mesa Blanca way, and Pike will feel at
home there. Don&rsquo;t you worry, I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on Pike.
He is hilariously happy to get into that region with a
partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she grumbled at him with sulky gray
eyes. &ldquo;Pedro Vijil just came back from the south, and
brought his sister&rsquo;s family from San Rafael. They&rsquo;re
refugees from the Federals because their men joined
Ramon Rotil, the rebel leader, and Merced is crying herself
crazy over the tales of war they tell. One of their
girls was stolen, and the mother and Tia Luz are both
crying over that. So Papa Phil says he&rsquo;s going to send
me away where I won&rsquo;t hear such horrors. I wish I was
a man, and I&rsquo;d join the army and get a chance to go over
and fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Rhodes skeptically, &ldquo;some more of
us had hopes! Our army officers are both praying and
cursing to get a chance to do the same thing, but they
are not getting it! So you and I, little girl, will wait till
some one pitches a bomb into that dovery on the Potomac.
Then we&rsquo;ll join the volunteers and swarm over after our
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, <i>you</i> can! Men can do anything they like. I
told you I was jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Lark-child,&rdquo; he returned soothingly.
&ldquo;If I get over with a gun, you can come along and toot
a horn. There now, that&rsquo;s a bargain, and you can practice
tooting the lark&rsquo;s call until the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to toot myself black
in the face before you show up again at Granados,&rdquo; she
prophesied ruefully, and he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistle an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come to you, Lassie,&rdquo; he said with
sudden recklessness, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s for <i>adios</i>, Billie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Rhodes,&rdquo; said a voice back of them,
and Singleton walked forward. &ldquo;When you got your
time, you were supposed to leave Granados. Is this what
you&rsquo;ve been hanging around for during the past week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes flamed red to his hair as he stared down at
the elder man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll not answer that now, Mr. Singleton,&rdquo;
he said quietly. &ldquo;You may live to see you made a mistake.
I hope you do, but you&rsquo;re traveling with a rotten
bunch, and they are likely to use a knife or a rope on
you any time you&rsquo;ve played the goat long enough for
them to get their innings. I&rsquo;m going without any grudge,
but if I was an insurance agent, trying to save money for
my company, I&rsquo;d sure pass you by as an unsafe bet!
Keep on this side of the line, Singleton, while the revolution
is whirling, and whatever you forget, don&rsquo;t forget
I said it! <i>Adios</i>, se&ntilde;orita, and&ndash;&ndash;good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Kit,&rdquo; she half whispered, &ldquo;and <i>adios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him as he rode away, watched him as he
halted at the turn of the trail and waved his hand, and
Singleton was quietly observing her the while. She
frowned as she turned and caught him at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought he waited here, or planned to&ndash;&ndash;to
meet me,&rdquo; she flared. &ldquo;He was too square to tell you
the truth, but it was I rode out here to say good-bye, rode
out and held him up! But I did not reckon anyone would
try to insult him for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her stepfather regarded her grimly. She was angry,
and very near to tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time you had your breakfast,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;and
all signs indicate I should have sent you East last year,
and kept you out of the promiscuous mixups along the
border. It&rsquo;s the dumping ground for all sorts of stray
adventurers, and no place for a girl to ride alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to think I am as able to look after myself
as you,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t fair to him because
you take the word of Conrad, but Conrad lies, and I&rsquo;m
glad he got thrashed good and plenty! Now I&rsquo;ve got
that off my mind, I&rsquo;ll go eat a cheerful breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singleton walked silent beside her back to where his
horse was grazing by the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the girl with frank scorn. &ldquo;So you
got out of the saddle to spy? Haven&rsquo;t you some black-and-tan
around the ranch to do your dirty work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well to be civil till you know what you
are talking about,&rdquo; he reminded her with a sort of
trained patience. &ldquo;I came out without my breakfast just
to keep the ranchmen from thinking what Tia Luz thinks.
She told me I&rsquo;d find that fellow waiting for you. I didn&rsquo;t
believe it, but I see she is not so far wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke without heat or feeling, and his tone was
that of quiet discussion with a man or boy, not at all
that of a guardian to a girl. His charge was evidently
akin to the horse ranch of Granados as described by the
old ranger: Singleton had acquired them, but never understood
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e with boyish roughness,
&ldquo;that Dutchman sees everything crooked, especially if
there&rsquo;s an American in range, and he prejudices you.
Why don&rsquo;t you wake up long enough to notice that he&rsquo;s
framing some excuse to run off every decent chap who
comes on the place? I knew Rhodes was too white to be
let stay. I saw that as soon as he landed, and I told
him so! What I can&rsquo;t understand is that you won&rsquo;t
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A manager has to have a free hand, Billie, or else be
let go,&rdquo; explained Singleton. &ldquo;Conrad knows horses, he
knows the market, and is at home with the Mexicans.
Also he costs less than we used to pay, and that is an item
in a bad year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet we lose enough cattle to his friends to make
up the difference,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Rhodes was right
when he called them a rotten bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope that when you return from school you
will have lost the major portion of your unsavory vocabulary,&rdquo;
he suggested. &ldquo;That will be worth a herd of
cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be worth another herd to see you wake up
and show you had one good fight in you!&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;Conrad has all of the ranch outfit locoed but me; that&rsquo;s
why he passes on this school notion to you. He wants
me out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been more decided, and insisted that
you go last year. Heaven knows you need it badly
enough,&rdquo; sighed Singleton, ignoring her disparaging comment
on his own shortcomings. And then as they rode
under the swaying fronds of the palm drive leading to
the ranch house he added, &ldquo;Those words of your bronco
busting friend concerning the life insurance risk sounded
like a threat. I wonder what he meant by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone bell on the Granados Junction line was
ringing when they entered the patio. Singleton glanced
at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A night letter probably,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Go get your
coffee, child, it&rsquo;s a late hour for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie obeyed, sulkily seating herself opposite Tia Luz&ndash;&ndash;who
was bolt upright behind the coffee urn, with a
mien expressing dignified disapproval. She inhaled a
deep breath for forceful speech, but Billie was ahead of
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you! You were the spy, and sent him after
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i> and why not?&rdquo; demanded the competent
Luz. &ldquo;You stealing your own horse at the dawn to
go with the old Captain Pike. I ask of you what kind of
a girl is that? Also Mercedes was here last night tearing
her hair because of the girls, her sister&rsquo;s daughters, stolen
away over there in Sonora. Well! is that not enough?
That Se&ntilde;or Kit is also too handsome. I was a fool to
send the medicine with you to Pedro&rsquo;s house. He looked
a fine caballero but even a fine caballero will take a girl
when she follows after. <i>I</i> know! And once in Sonora
all trails of a girl are lost. I know that too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all crazy, and I never saw him at Pedro&rsquo;s
house, never!&rdquo; said the girl reaching for her coffee, and
then suddenly she began to laugh. &ldquo;Did you think, did
you make Papa Philip think, that I was eloping like
this?&rdquo; and she glanced down at her denim riding dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not? Did I myself not steal out in a shift
and petticoat the first time I tried to run away with my
Andreas? And beyond that not a thing under God had
I on but my coral beads, and the red satin slippers of my
sister Dorotea! She pulled my hair wickedly for those
slippers, and I got a <i>reata</i> on my back from my grandmother
for that running away. I was thirteen years old
then! But when I was nearly sixteen we did get away,
Andreas and I, and after that it was as well for the grandmother
to pay a priest for us, and let us alone. Ai-ji!
se&ntilde;orita, I am not forgetting what I know! And while I
am here in Granados there must be nothing less than a
grand marriage, and may the saints send the right man,
for a wrong one makes hell in any house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie forgot her sulkiness in her joy at the elopements
of Tia Luz. No wonder she distrusted an American girl
who was allowed to ride alone!</p>
<p>But in the midst of her laughter she was reminded that
Singleton was still detained at the telephone in the adjoining
room, and that his rather high-pitched tones
betrayed irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why can&rsquo;t you give the telegram to me? Addressed
to Conrad? Of course if it&rsquo;s a personal message
I don&rsquo;t want it, but you say it is a ranch matter&ndash;&ndash;and
important. Horses? What about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie, listening, sped from the table to his side, and
putting her hand over the telephone, whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Brehman, the secretary, was here, they&rsquo;d give it to
him. They always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singleton nodded to her, and grew decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Webster, one of our men was hurt, and
Brehman took his place and went East with that horse
shipment. Mr. Conrad had to go down in Sonora on
business, and I am the only one here to take his place.
Just give me the message as you would give it to the
secretary. But you&rsquo;d better type a copy and send by mail
that I can put it on file. All right? Yes, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie had quickly secured paper and pencil, but instead
of taking them, Singleton motioned for her to write the
message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adolf Conrad, Granados Ranch, Granados Junction, Arizona.
Regret to report September shipment horses developed
ailment aboard vessel, fifty per cent dead, balance
probably of no military use,</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Ogden, Burns &amp; Co.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Word by word Singleton took the message and word
by word Billie wrote it down, while they stared at each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Developed ailment aboard vessel!&rdquo; repeated Singleton.
&ldquo;Then there was something wrong on shipboard, for
there certainly is not here. We have no sick horses on
the ranch, never do have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these people?&rdquo; and Billie pointed to the signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are the men who buy stock for the Allies,
agents for the French. They paid for the horses on delivery.
They are safe, substantial people. I can&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Billie caught his arm with a gasp of horror and
enlightenment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa Phil! Think&ndash;&ndash;<i>think</i> what Kit Rhodes said!
<i>&lsquo;Ground glass in the feed at the other end of the road!
Conrad&rsquo;s game&ndash;&ndash;Herrara knows!&rsquo;</i> Papa Phil,&ndash;&ndash;Miguel
Herrara was killed&ndash;&ndash;killed! And Conrad tried to kill
Kit! Oh he did, he did! None of the Mexicans thought
he would get well, but Tia Luz cured him. And Cap
Pike never went out of sight of that adobe until Conrad
had left the ranch, and I know Kit was right. I know
it, I know it! Oh, my horses, my beautiful horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there! Why, child you&rsquo;re hysterical over this,
which is&ndash;&ndash;is too preposterous for belief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is too preposterous for belief. You know
that. Everybody knows it in these days! Is Belgium too
preposterous? Is that record of poison and powdered
glass in hospital supplies too preposterous? In <i>hospital</i>
supplies! If they do that to wounded men, why not to
cavalry horses? Why Papa Phil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush&ndash;&ndash;hush&ndash;&ndash;hush!&rdquo; he said pacing the floor,
clasping his head in both hands. &ldquo;It is too terrible!
What can we do? What? Who dare we trust to even
help investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might wire those agents for particulars,
this is rather skimpy,&rdquo; suggested Billie. &ldquo;Come and get
some breakfast and think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might wire the office of the Peace Society in New
York to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; protested Billie. &ldquo;They may have
furnished the poison for all <i>you</i> know! Cap Pike says
they are a lot of traitors, and Cap is wise in lots of
things. You telegraph, and you tell them that if the
sickness is proven to have started in Granados, that we
will pay for every dead horse, tell them we have no sick
horses here, and ask them to answer, <i>pronto!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems rather reckless, child, to pay for all&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> reckless! I am crazy mad over those horses,
and over Conrad, and over Kit whom he tried to kill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut&ndash;&ndash;tut! The language and behavior of Rhodes
was too wicked for anyone to believe him innocent. He
was a beastly looking object, and I still believe him entirely
in the wrong. This loss of the horses is deplorable,
but you will find that no one at Granados is to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but you just send that telegram and see
what we see!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A DEAD MAN UNDER THE COTTONWOODS</h3>
</div>
<p>Billie was never out of hearing of the telephone all
day, and at two o&rsquo;clock the reply came.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Philip Singleton,</span>
      Rancho Granados, Arizona.</p>
<p>Kindly wire in detail the source of your information. No
message went to Granados from this office. No publicity
has been given to the dead horse situation. Your inquiry
very important to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Ogden, Burns &amp; Co.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange, very!&rdquo; murmured Singleton. &ldquo;No
matter how hard I think, or from what angle, I can&rsquo;t
account for it. Billie, this is too intricate for me. The
best thing I can do is to go over to Nogales and talk to
an attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and talk,&rdquo; agreed Billie, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d answer
that telegram first. This is no township matter, Papa
Phil, can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, but simply because of that fact
I feel I should have local advice. I have a legal friend
in Nogales. If I could get him on the wire&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later when Billie returned from a ride, she
realized Singleton had gotten his friend on the wire, for
she heard him talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Granados. Is that you, James? Yes, I
asked them to have you call me. I need to consult with
you concerning a rather serious matter. Yes, so serious
I may say it is mysterious, and appalling. It concerns
a shipment of horses. Conrad is in Sonora, and this
subject can&rsquo;t wait&ndash;&ndash;no, I can&rsquo;t get in touch with Conrad.
He is out of communication when over there&ndash;&ndash;No,
I can&rsquo;t wait his return. I&rsquo;ve had a wire from Ogden and
Burns, New York&ndash;&ndash;said Ogden and Burns&ndash;&ndash;All right,
get a pencil; I&rsquo;ll hold the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, and if a telephonic
camera had been installed at Granados, Mr. Singleton
might have caught a very interesting picture at the other
end of the wire.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man in rusty black of semi-clerical cut
held the receiver, and the effect of the names as given over
the wire was, to put it mildly, electrical. His jaw dropped
and he stared across the table at a man who was seated
there. At the repetition of the name, the other arose, and
with the stealthily secretive movement of a coyote near
its prey he circled the table, and drew a chair close to the
telephone. The pencil and paper was in his hand, not in
that of &ldquo;James.&rdquo; That other was Conrad.</p>
<p>Then the telephone conversation was resumed after
Mr. Singleton had been requested to speak a little louder&ndash;&ndash;there
seemed some flaw in the connection.</p>
<p>In the end Singleton appeared much comforted to get
the subject off his own shoulders by discussing it with
another. But he had been convinced that the right thing
to do was to motor over to the Junction and take the
telegrams with him for consultation. He would start
about eight in the morning, and would reach the railroad
by noon. Yes, by taking the light car which he drove
himself it would be an easy matter.</p>
<p>Billie heard part of this discourse in an absent-minded
way, for she was not at all interested as to what some
strange lawyer in Nogales might think of the curious
telegrams.</p>
<p>She would have dropped some of that indifference if
she had been able to hear the lurid language of Conrad
after the receiver was hung up. James listened to him in
silence for a bit, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your move, brother! There are not supposed to
be any mistakes in the game, and you have permitted our
people to wire you a victory when you were not there to
get the wire, and that was a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Brehman always&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent Brehman East and for once forgot what
might happen with your office empty. No,&ndash;&ndash;it is not
Singleton&rsquo;s fault; he did the natural thing. It is not the
operator&rsquo;s fault; why should he not give a message concerning
horses to the proprietor of the horse ranch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Singleton never before made a move in anything
of management, letters never opened, telegrams filed but
never answers sent until I am there! And this time!
It is that most cursed Rhodes, I know it is that one!
They told me he was high in fever and growing worse,
and luck with me! So you yourself know the necessity
that I go over for the Sonora conference&ndash;&ndash;there was no
other way. It is that Rhodes! Yes, I know it, and they
told me he was as good as dead&ndash;&ndash;God! if again I get
him in these hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paced the floor nervously, and flung out his clenched
hands in fury, and the quiet man watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is personal, and is for the future,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
Singleton is not a personal matter. If he lives he will
be influenced to investigation, and that must not be. It
would remove you from Granados, and you are too valuable
at that place. You must hold that point as you would
hold a fort against the enemy. When Mexico joins with
Germany against the damned English and French, this
fool mushroom republic will protest, and that is the time
our friends will sweep over from Mexico and gather in
all these border states&ndash;&ndash;which were once hers&ndash;&ndash;and will
again be hers through the strong mailed hand of Germany!
This is written and will be! When that day
comes, we need such points of vantage as Granados and
La Partida; we must have them! You have endangered
that position, and the mistake won&rsquo;t be wiped out. The
next move is yours, Conrad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet man in the habiliments of shabby gentility
in that bare little room with the American flag over the
door and portraits of two or three notable advocates of
World Peace and the American League of Neutrality on
the wall, had all the outward suggestion of the small
town disciple of Socialism from the orthodox viewpoint.
His manner was carefully restrained, and his low voice
was very even, but at his last words Conrad who had
dropped into a seat, his head in his hands, suddenly looked
up, questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singleton can probably do no more harm today,&rdquo;
went on the quiet voice. &ldquo;I warned him it would be a
mistake to discuss it until after he had seen me. He
starts at eight in the morning, alone, for the railroad but
probably will not reach there.&rdquo; He looked at his watch
thoughtfully. &ldquo;The Tucson train leaves in fifty minutes.
You can get that. Stop off at the station where Brehman&rsquo;s
sister is waitress. She will have his car ready, that
will avoid the Junction. It will be rough work, Conrad,
but it is your move. It is an order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then before that carefully quiet man who had
the appearance of a modest country person, Adolf Conrad
suddenly came to his feet in military salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we will talk it over,&rdquo; suggested his superior.
&ldquo;It will be rough, yet necessary, and if it could appear
suicide, eh? Well, we will see. We&ndash;&ndash;will&ndash;&ndash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At seven in the morning the Granados telephone bell
brought Singleton into the patio in his dressing gown and
slippers. And Do&ntilde;a Luz who was seeing that his breakfast
was served, heard him express surprise and then say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. If you are coming this way as far
on the road as the Jefferson ranch of course we can meet
there, and I only need to go half way. That will be excellent.
Yes, and if Judge Jefferson is at home he may
be able to help with his advice. Fine! Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Do&ntilde;a Luz was questioned about it later she was
quite sure Mr. Singleton mentioned no name, his words
were as words to a friend.</p>
<p>But all that day the telephone was out of order on the
Granados line, and Singleton did not return that night.
There was nothing to cause question in that, as he had
probably gone on to Nogales, but when the second day
came and the telephone not working, Billie started Pedro
Vijil to ride the line to Granados Junction, get the mail,
and have a line man sent out for repairs wherever they
were needed.</p>
<p>It was puzzling because there had been no storm, nothing
of which they knew to account for the silent wire.
The line was an independent one from the Junction, and
there were only two stations on it, the Jefferson ranch
and Granados.</p>
<p>But Vijil forgot about the wire, for he met some sheep
men from the hills carrying the body of Singleton. They
had found him in the cottonwoods below the road not
five miles from the hacienda. His car he had driven off
the road back of a clump of thick mesquite. The revolver
was still in his hand, and the right temple covered
with black blood and flies.</p>
<p>There was nothing better to do than what the herders
were doing. The man had been dead a day and must be
buried, also it was necessary to send a man to Jefferson&rsquo;s,
where there was a telephone, to get in touch with someone
in authority and arrange for the funeral.</p>
<p>So the herders walked along with their burden carried
in a <i>serape</i>, and covered by the carriage robe. Pedro had
warned them to halt at his own house, for telephone calls
would certainly gather men, who would help to arrange
all decently before the body was taken into the <i>sala</i> of
Granados.</p>
<p>There is not much room for conjecture as to the means
of a man&rsquo;s taking off when he is found with a bullet in his
right temple, a revolver in his right hand, and only one
empty cartridge shell in the revolver. There seemed no
mystery about the death, except the cause of suicide.</p>
<p>It was the same evening that Conrad riding in from
the south, attempted to speak over the wire with Granados
and got from Central information that the Granados wire
was broken, and Singleton, the proprietor, a suicide.</p>
<p>The coroner&rsquo;s inquest so pronounced it, after careful
investigation of the few visible facts. Conrad was of no
value as a witness because he had been absent in Magdalena.
He could surmise no reason for such an act,
but confessed he knew practically nothing of Singleton&rsquo;s
personal affairs. He was guardian of his stepdaughter
and her estate, and so far as Conrad knew all his relations
with the personnel of the estate were most amicable.
Conrad acknowledged when questioned that Singleton
did usually carry a revolver when out in the car, he had a
horror of snakes, and he had never known him to use a
gun for anything else.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Luz Moreno confused matters considerably by
her statement that Mr. Singleton was going to meet some
man at the Jefferson ranch because the man had called
him up before breakfast to arrange it. Later it was
learned that no call was made from any station over
the wire that morning to Granados. There was in fact
several records of failure to get Granados. No one but
Do&ntilde;a Luz had heard the call and heard Singleton reply,
yet it was not possible that this communication could
be a fact over a broken wire, and the wire was found
broken between the Jefferson ranch and Granados.</p>
<p>Whereupon word promptly went abroad among the
Mexicans that Se&ntilde;or Singleton had been lured to his
death by a spirit voice calling over a broken wire as a
friend to a friend. For the rest of her life Do&ntilde;a Luz
will have that tale to tell as the evidence of her own ears
that warnings of death do come from the fearsome spirits
of the shadowed unknown land,&ndash;&ndash;and this in denial of all
the padres&rsquo; godly discourse to the contrary!</p>
<p>A Mr. Frederick James of Nogales, connected with a
group of charitable gentlemen working for the alleviating
of distress among the many border exiles from Mexico,
was the only person who came forward voluntarily to
offer help to the coroner regarding the object of the dead
man&rsquo;s journey to Nogales. Mr. James had been called
on the telephone by Mr. Singleton, who was apparently
in great distress of mind concerning mysterious illness
and deaths of horses shipped from Granados to France.
A telegram had come from New York warning him that
the Department of Justice was investigating the matter,
and the excitement and nervousness of Mr. Singleton was
such that Mr. James readily consented to a meeting in
Nogales, with the hope that he might be of service in any
investigation they would decide upon after consultation.
When Mr. Singleton did not keep the engagement, Mr.
James attempted to make inquiries by telephone. He
tried again the following morning, but it was only after
hearing of the suicide&ndash;&ndash;he begged pardon&ndash;&ndash;the death of
Mr. Singleton, that he recalled the fact that all of Singleton&rsquo;s
discourse over the telephone had been unusual, excitable
to a degree, while all acquaintances of the dead
man knew him as a quiet, reserved man, really unusually
reserved, almost to the point of the secretive. Mr. James
was struck by the unusual note of panic in his tones, but
as a carload of horses was of considerable financial value,
he ascribed the excitement in part to that, feeling confident
of course that Mr. Singleton was in no ways accountable
for the loss, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Mr. James was asked if the nervousness indicated by
Mr. Singleton was a fear of personal consequences following
the telegram, but Mr. James preferred not to say.
He had regarded Mr. Singleton as a model of most of the
virtues, and while Singleton&rsquo;s voice and manner had certainly
been unusual, he could not presume to suspect the
inner meaning of it.</p>
<p>The telegraph and telephone records bore out the testimony
of Mr. James.</p>
<p>The fact that the first telegram was addressed to the
manager, Mr. Conrad, had apparently nothing to do with
the case, since the telegraph files showed that messages
were about evenly divided in the matter of address concerning
ranch matters. They were often addressed simply
to &ldquo;Granados Rancho&rdquo; or &ldquo;Manager Granados Ranch.&rdquo;
This one simply happened to be addressed to the name of
the manager.</p>
<p>The coroner decided that the mode of address had no
direct bearing on the fact that the man was found dead
under the cottonwoods with copies of both telegrams in
his pocket, both written in a different hand from his carefully
clear script as shown in his address book. Safe in
his pocket also was money, a gold watch with a small
gold compass, and a handsome seal ring. Nothing was
missing, which of course precluded the thought of murder
for robbery, and Philip Singleton was too mildly negative
to make personal enemies, a constitutional neutral.</p>
<p>Billie, looking very small and very quiet, was brought
in by Do&ntilde;a Luz and Mr. Jefferson of the neighboring
ranch, fifty miles to the east. She had not been weeping.
She was too stunned for tears, and there was a strangely
ungirlish tension about her, an alert questioning in her
eyes as she looked from face to face, and then returned
to the face of the one man who was a stranger, the kindly
sympathetic face of Mr. Frederick James.</p>
<p>She told of the telegrams she had copied, and of the
distress of Singleton, but that his distress was no more
than her own, that she had been crying about the horses,
and he had tried to comfort her. She did not believe he
had a trouble in the world of his own, and he had never
killed himself&ndash;&ndash;never!</p>
<p>When asked if she had any reason to suspect a murderer,
she said if they ever found who killed the horses
they would find who killed her Papa Phil, but this opinion
was evidently not shared by any of the others. The
report of horses dead on a transport in the Atlantic ocean,
and a man dead under the cottonwoods in Arizona, did
not appear to have any definite physical relation to each
other, unless of course the loss of the horses had proven
too much of a shock to Mr. Singleton and upset his
nerves to the extent that moody depression had developed
into temporary dementia. His own gun had been the evident
agent of death.</p>
<p>One of the Mexicans recalled that Singleton had discharged
an American foreman in anger, and that the man
had been in a rage about it, and assaulted Mr. Conrad,
whereupon Conrad was recalled, and acknowledged the
assault with evident intent to kill. Yes, he heard the man
Rhodes had threatened Singleton with a nastier accident
than his attempt on Conrad. No, he had not heard it
personally, as he was unconscious when the threat was
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a threat!&rdquo; interrupted Billie, &ldquo;it was something
different, a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warning of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie was about to quote Kit&rsquo;s opinion concerning
Singleton&rsquo;s ranch force, when she was halted by a strange
thing&ndash;&ndash;for Billie; it was merely the mild steady gaze
of the quiet gentleman of the peaceful league of the neutrals.
There was a slight lifting of his brows as she
spoke of a warning; and then a slight suggestion of a
smile&ndash;&ndash;it might have been a perfectly natural incredulous
smile, but Billie felt that it was not. The yellowish
brown eyes narrowed until only the pupils were visible,
and warm though the day was, Billie felt a swift chill
over her, and her words were cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, I don&rsquo;t know, but Kit Rhodes had no
grudge against Papa Phil. He seemed in some way to
be sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She noted that Conrad&rsquo;s gaze was on the face of Mr.
James instead of on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, sort of. He tried to explain why, but Papa
would not listen, and would not make any engagement
with him. Sent his money by Captain Pike and wouldn&rsquo;t
see him. But Kit Rhodes did not make a threat, he
did not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her last denial was directly at Conrad, who merely
shrugged his shoulders as if to dispose of that awkward
phase of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was told me so, but the Mexican men might not
have understood the words of Rhodes&ndash;&ndash;he was in a rage&ndash;&ndash;and
it may be he did not mean so much as he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; insisted Billie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, he did not, and it is a mistake of mine,&rdquo;
agreed Conrad politely. &ldquo;For quite awhile I was unconscious
after his assault, naturally I know nothing of
what was said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is this man Rhodes to be found?&rdquo; asked
the coroner, and Conrad smiled meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere,&ndash;&ndash;or so I am told! He and a companion
are said to have crossed the line into Sonora twenty-four
hours before the death of Mr. Singleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, unless there is some evidence that he was seen
later on this side, any threat he might or might not have
made, has no relation whatever to this case. Is there any
evidence that he was seen at, or near, Granados after
starting for Sonora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No evidence was forthcoming, and the coroner, in
summoning up, confessed he was not satisfied to leave
certain details of the case a mystery.</p>
<p>That Singleton had discharged Rhodes in anger, and
Rhodes had, even by intimation, voiced a threat against
Singleton could not be considered as having any bearing
on the death of the latter; while the voice of the unknown
calling him to a meeting at Jefferson&rsquo;s ranch was equally
a matter of mystery, since no one at Jefferson&rsquo;s knew
anything of the message, or the speaker, and investigation
developed the fact that the telephone wire was broken
between the two ranches, and there was no word at
Granados Junction Central of any message to Granados
after five o&rsquo;clock the afternoon of the previous day.</p>
<p>And, since Philip Singleton never reached the Jefferson
ranch, but turned his car off the road at the cottonwood
ca&ntilde;on, and was found with one bullet in his head, and
the gun in his own hand, it was not for a coroner&rsquo;s jury
to conjecture the impulse leading up to the act, or the
business complications by which the act might, or might
not, have been hastened. But incomprehensible though
it might seem to all concerned there was only one finding
on the evidence submitted, and that was suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa Phil never killed himself, never!&rdquo; declared
Billie. &ldquo;That would be two suicides in a month for
Granados, and two is one too many. We never had
suicides here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miguel Herrara who had been arrested for
smuggling, was searched and his gun taken, and yet that
night found a gun to kill himself with in the adobe where
he was locked up! Miguel would not have cared for a
year or two in jail; he had lived there before, and hadn&rsquo;t
tried any killing. I tell you Granados is getting more
than its share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure looks like it, little lady,&rdquo; agreed the coroner,
&ldquo;but Herrara&rsquo;s death gives us no light or evidence on
Singleton&rsquo;s death, and our jurisdiction is limited strictly
to the hand that held the gun. The evidence shows it was
in the hand of Mr. Singleton when found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jeffersons insisted that Billie go home with them,
as the girl appeared absolutely and pathetically alone in
the world. She knew of no relatives, and Tia Luz and
Captain Pike were the only two whom she had known
from babyhood as friends of her father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The grandmother of Billie Bernard had been the daughter
of a Spanish <i>haciendado</i> who was also an officer in
the army of Mexico. He met death in battle before he
ever learned that his daughter, in the pious work of nursing
friend and enemy alike, had nursed one enemy of
the hated North until each was captive to the other, and
she rode beside him to her father&rsquo;s farthest northern
rancho beyond the Mexican deserts, and never went
again to the gay circles of Mexico&rsquo;s capital. Late in her
life one daughter, Dorotea was born, and when Alfred
Bernard came out of the East and looked on her, a blonde
Spanish girl as her ancestresses of Valencia had been,
the game of love was played again in the old border
rancho which was world enough for the lovers. There
had been one eastern summer for them the first year of
their marriage, and Philip Singleton had seen her there,
and never forgot her. After her widowhood he crossed
the continent to be near her, and after awhile his devotion,
and her need of help in many ways, won the place
he coveted, and life at Granados went on serenely until
her death. Though he had at times been bored a bit by
the changelessness of ranch life, yet he had given his
word to guard the child&rsquo;s inheritance until she came of
age, and had kept it loyally as he knew how until death
met him in the ca&ntilde;on of the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>But the contented isolation of her immediate family
left Billie only such guardian as the court might appoint
for her property and person, and Andrew Jefferson,
Judge Jefferson by courtesy, in the county, would no
doubt be choice of the court as well as the girl. Beyond
that she could only think of Pike, and&ndash;&ndash;well Pike was
out of reach on some enchanted gold trail of which she
must not speak, and she supposed she would have to go
to school instead of going in search of him!</p>
<p>Conrad spoke to her kindly as she was led to the Jefferson
car, and there was a subtle deference in his
manner, indicating his realization that he was speaking&ndash;&ndash;not
to the wilful little maid who could be annoying&ndash;&ndash;but
to the owner of Granados and, despite his five year contract
as manager, an owner who could change entirely
the activities of the two ranches in another year&ndash;&ndash;and
it was an important year.</p>
<p>He also spoke briefly to Mr. James offering him the
hospitality of the ranch for a day of rest before returning
to Nogales, but the offer was politely declined. Mr.
James intimated that he was at Conrad&rsquo;s service if he
could be of any practical use in the mysterious situation.
He carefully gave his address and telephone number, and
bade the others good day. But as he was entering his
little roadster he spoke again to Conrad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, it was a mistake to let that man Rhodes
get over into Sonora. It should be the task of someone
to see that he does not come back. He seems a very dangerous
man. See to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were those of a kindly person interested
in the welfare of the community, and evidently impressed
by the evidence referring to the discharged range boss.
Two of the men hearing him exchanged glances, for they
also thought that rumor of the threats should have been
looked into. But the last three words were spoken too
softly for any but Conrad to hear.</p>
<p>The following week Billie went to Tucson with the
Jeffersons and at her request Judge Jefferson was appointed
guardian of her person and estate, after which
she and the judge went into a confidential session concerning
that broken wire on the Granados line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not loco, Judge,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;but I want you to
learn whether that wire was cut on purpose, or just broke
itself. Also I want you to take up that horse affair with
the secret service people. I don&rsquo;t want Conrad to be sent
away&ndash;&ndash;yet. I&rsquo;d rather watch him on Granados. I
won&rsquo;t go away to school; I&rsquo;d rather have a teacher at
home. We can find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, do you realize that with two mysterious deaths
on Granados lately, you might run some personal risk of
living there with only yourself and two women in the
house? I&rsquo;m not sure we can sanction that, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie smiled at him a bit wanly, but decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Judge, you know I picked you because you
would let me do whatever I pleased, and I don&rsquo;t mean to
be disappointed with you. Half the men at the inquest
think that Kit Rhodes did come back to do that shooting,
and you know Conrad and the very smooth rat of the
Charities Society are accountable for that opinion. The
Mexican who dragged in Kit&rsquo;s name is one of Conrad&rsquo;s
men; it all means something! It&rsquo;s a bad muddle, but
Kit Rhodes and Cap Pike will wander back here some of
these days, and I mean to have every bit of evidence for
Kit to start in with. He suspected a lot, and all Granados
combined to silence him&ndash;&ndash;fool Granados!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, just between ourselves, child, are you convinced
Rhodes did not make the statement liable to be construed
into a threat against Mr. Singleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convinced nothing,&rdquo; was the inelegant reply of his
new ward. &ldquo;I heard him say enough to hang him if evidence
could be found that he was north of the line that
morning, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s my job to take note of all the
evidence on the other side. The horses did not kill themselves.
That telegram concerning it did not send itself.
Papa Phil did not shoot himself, and that telephone wire
did not cut itself! My hunch is that those four things go
together, and that&rsquo;s a combination they can&rsquo;t clear up by
dragging in the name of a man who never saw the horses,
and who was miles south in Sonora with Cap Pike when
the other three things happened. Now can they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! For the love of Mike! Bub, can&rsquo;t you give
a man a rest instead of piling up the agony?
These old joints of mine are creakin&rsquo; with every move
from desert rust and dry camps, and you with no more
heart in you than to sing of springs,&ndash;&ndash;cold springs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do exist, Cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&ndash;&ndash;huh, they are as real to us this minute as the
red gold that we&rsquo;ve trailed until we&rsquo;re at the tag end of
our grub stake. I tell you, Bub, they stacked the cards
on us with that door of the old Soledad Mission, and the
view of the gold ca&ntilde;on from there! Why, Whitely
showed us that the mission door never did face the hills,
but looked right down the valley towards the Rio del
Altar just as the Soledad plaza does today; all the old
Mexicans and Indians tell us that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve combed over most of the arroyas leading
into the Altar from Rancho Soledad, and all we&rsquo;ve found
is placer gravel; yet the placers are facts, and the mother
lode is somewhere, Cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worn down to pan dirt, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; grunted Pike.
&ldquo;I tell you these heathen sit around and dream lost mission
tales and lost mine lies; dream them by the dozen
to delude just such innocent yaps as you and me. They&rsquo;ve
nothing else to do between crops. We should have stuck
to a white man&rsquo;s land, north into Arizona where the Three
Hills of Gold are waiting, to say nothing of the Lost
Stone Cabin mine, lost not twenty miles from Quartzite,
and in plain sight of Castle Dome. Now there is nothing
visionary about <i>that</i>, Kit! Why, I knew an old-timer
who freighted rich ore out of that mine thirty years ago,
and even the road to it has been lost for years! We
know things once did exist up in that country, Kit, and
down here we are all tangled up with Mexican-Indian
stories of ghosts and enchantments, and such vagaries.
I&rsquo;m fed up with them to the limit, for everyone of them
we listen to is different from the last. We&rsquo;ll head up into
the Castle Dome country next time, hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I hear,&rdquo; agreed Kit cheerfully. &ldquo;Perhaps we
do lose, but it&rsquo;s not so bad. Since Whitely sent his family
north, he has intimated that Mesa Blanca is a single
man&rsquo;s job, and I reckon I can have it when he goes&ndash;&ndash;as
he will. Then in the month we have scouted free of
Whitelys, we have dry washed enough dust to put you
on velvet till things come our way. Say, what will you
bet that a month of comfort around Nogales won&rsquo;t make
you hungry for the trail again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gold trail?&rdquo; queried the weary and dejected Pike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any old trail to any old place just so we keep
ambling on. You can&rsquo;t live contented under cover, and
you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Pike after a rod or two of tramping
along the shaly, hot bed of a dry arroya. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bet,
for you may be among the prophets. But while you are
about it, I&rsquo;d be thankful if you&rsquo;d prophesy me a wet trail
next time instead of skimpy mud holes where springs
ought to be. I&rsquo;m sick of dry camps, and so is Baby
Buntin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Oh, there was a frog lived in the spring!&rsquo;</i>&rdquo; chanted
Kit derisively. &ldquo;Cheer up, Cap, the worst is yet to come,
for I&rsquo;ve an idea that the gang of Mexican vaqueros we
glimpsed from the butte at noon will just about muss up
the water hole in Yaqui ca&ntilde;on until it will be us for a
sleep there before the fluid is fit for a water bottle. <i>&lsquo;Oh,
there was a frog lived in the spring!&rsquo;</i> Buntin&rsquo; Baby,
we&rsquo;ll fish the frog out, and let you wallow in it instead,
you game little dusty rat! Say, Pike, when we load up
with grub again we&rsquo;ll keep further west to the Cerrado
Pintado. I&rsquo;ll follow a hunch of my own next trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man grunted disdain for the hunches of Kit,
even while his eyes smiled response to the ever-living call
of youth. To Rhodes there was ever a &ldquo;next time.&rdquo; He
was young enough to deal in futures, and had a way with
him by which friends were to be found for even unstable
venturings with no backing more substantial than a
&ldquo;hunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that Kit was gifted with any great degree of fatal
beauty&ndash;&ndash;men are not often pretty on the trail, unwashed,
unshaven, and unshorn&ndash;&ndash;added to which their equipment
had reached the point where his most pretentious
garment was a square of an Indian <i>serape</i> with a hole in
the middle worn as a poncho, and adopted to save his coat
and other shirt on the hard trail.</p>
<p>Cap Pike growled that he looked like a Mexican peon
in that raiment, which troubled Kit not at all. He was
red bronze from the desert days, and his blue eyes, with
the long black lashes of some Celtic ancestor, looked out
on the world with direct mild approval. They matched
the boyish voice much given to trolling old-time ditties
and sentimental foolishness.</p>
<p>He led the dappled roan over the wild dry &ldquo;wash&rdquo;
where the sand was deep and slippery, and the white
crust of alkali over all. Before him swayed the pack
mules, and back of him Captain Pike sagged on the little
gray burro, named in derision and affection, the Baby
Bunting of the outfit.</p>
<p>The jauntiness was temporarily eliminated from the
old prospector. Two months of fruitless scratching
gravel when he had expected to walk without special
delay to the great legendary deposit, had taken the sparkle
of hope from the blue eyes, and he glanced perfunctorily
at the walls of that which had once been a river bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in time do you reckon became of all the water
that used to fill these dry gullies?&rdquo; he asked querulously.
&ldquo;Why, it took a thousand years of floods to wash these
boulders round, and then leave them high and dry when
nicely polished. That&rsquo;s a waste in nature I can&rsquo;t figure
out, and this godforsaken territory is full of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you grouch, if we didn&rsquo;t have this dry bed to
skip along, we would be bucking the greasewood and
cactus on the mesa above. So we get some favors coming
our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip along,&ndash;&ndash;me eye!&rdquo; grunted Pike, as the burro
toiled laboriously through the sand, and Kit shifted and
stumbled over treacherous, half-buried boulders. &ldquo;Say,
Kit, don&rsquo;t you reckon it&rsquo;s time for Billie to answer my
letter? It&rsquo;s over eight weeks now, and mail ought to get
in once a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes grunted something about &ldquo;mail in normal
times, but these times were not normal,&rdquo; and did not seem
much interested in word from Granados.</p>
<p>He had not the heart, or else had too much, to tell the
old man that the letter to Billie never reached her. When
Whitely went north he put it in his coat pocket, and then
changed his coat! Kit found it a month later and held
it, waiting to find someone going out. He had not even
mentioned it to Whitely on his return, for Whitely was
having his own troubles, and could not spare a man for
a four day trip to mail.</p>
<p>Whitely&rsquo;s folks lived north of Naco, and he had gone
there direct and returned without touching at Nogales, or
hearing of the tragedy at Granados. The latest news of
the Mexican revolutions, and the all-absorbing question
as to whether the United States would or would not intervene,
seemed all the news the worried Whitely had
brought back. Even the slaughter of a dozen nations of
Europe had no new features to a ranchman of Sonora,&ndash;&ndash;it
remained just slaughter. And one did not need to cross
boundaries to learn of killings, for all the world seemed
aflame, and every state in Mexico had its own wars,&ndash;&ndash;little
or big.</p>
<p>Then, in the records of the tumultuous days, there was
scarce space for the press or people to give thought after
the first day or two, to the colorless life going out in
mystery under the cottonwoods of Granados, and no word
came to tell Rhodes of the suspicion, only half veiled,
against himself.</p>
<p>The ranch house of Mesa Blanca was twenty miles
from the hacienda of Soledad, and a sharp spur of the
Carrizal range divided their grazing lands. Soledad
reached a hundred miles south and Mesa Blanca claimed
fifty miles to the west, so that the herds seldom mingled,
but word filtered to and from between the vaqueros, and
Rhodes heard that Perez had come north from Hermosillo
and that El Aleman, (the German) had made the two day
trip in from the railroad, and had gone on a little <i>pasear</i>
to the small rancherias with Juan Gonsalvo, the half-breed
overseer. The vaqueros talked with each other
about that, for there were no more young men among
them for soldiers, only boys and old men to tend the
cattle, and what did it mean?</p>
<p>The name of Rhodes was not easy for the Mexican
tongue, and at Mesa Blanca his identity was promptly
lost in the gift of a name with a meaning to them, El
Pajarito, (the singer).
Capitan Viajo, (the old captain),
was accepted by Pike with equal serenity, as both men
were only too well pleased to humor the Indian ranch
people in any friendly concessions, for back of some of
those alert black eyes there were surely inherited records
of old pagan days, and old legends of golden veins in the
hills.</p>
<p>The fact that they were left practically nameless in a
strange territory did not occur to either of them, and
would not have disturbed them if it had. They had met
no American but Whitely since they first struck Mesa
Blanca. One month Kit had conscientiously stuck to the
ranch cares while Whitely took his family out, and Pike
had made little sallies into the hills alone.</p>
<p>On Whitely&rsquo;s return he had made an errand to Soledad
and taken Rhodes and Pike along that they might view the
crumbled walls of old Soledad Mission, back of the ranch
house. The ancient rooms of the mission padres were
now used principally as corrals, harness shop, and storage
rooms.</p>
<p>The situation in itself was one of rare beauty;&ndash;&ndash;those
old padres knew!</p>
<p>It was set on a high plain or mesa, facing a wide valley
spreading miles away to the south where mother-of-pearl
mountains were ranged like strung jewels far against the
Mexican sky. At the north, slate-blue foothills lifted
their sharp-edged shoulders three miles away, but only
blank walls of Soledad faced the hills, all portals of the
old mission appeared to have faced south, as did Soledad.
The door facing the hills was a myth. And as Rhodes
stood north of the old wall, and searched its thirty-mile
circle, he could understand how four generations of gold
seekers had failed to find even a clue to the wealth those
unknown padres had looked on, and sent joyous evidence
of to the viceroy of the south. It would take years of
systematic search to cover even half the visible range.
A man could devote a long lifetime to a fruitless search
there, and then some straying burro might uncover it for
an Indian herder who would fill his poncho, and make a
sensation for a week or two, and never find the trail
again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just luck!&rdquo; said Kit thinking it all over as he
tramped along the arroya bed, &ldquo;it either belongs to you,
or it doesn&rsquo;t. No man on earth can buy it and make
it stay, but if it is yours, no man can keep you from it
entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil are you yammering about?&rdquo; asked
Pike grumpily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just thinking of how Whitely exploded our
little balloon of hopes when he took us over to size up
the prospects at Soledad. I wonder if Perez has no white
help at all around that place. We did not even see the
foreman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a half-breed, that Juan Gonsalvo. The Indians
don&rsquo;t like him. He&rsquo;s from down Hermosillo way, and not
like these Piman children of nature. He and Conrad
are up to some devilment, but Whitely thinks Juan took
the job, deluded as we are, with the notion that a gold
mine was sticking up out of the ground at the Soledad
corrals, and it was to be his find. You see, Bub, that
story has gone the length of Mexico, and even over to
Spain. Oh, we are not the only trailers of ghost gold;
there are others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slanting sun was sending shadows long on the
levels, and the hills were looming to the east in softest
tones of gray and amethyst; the whitish green of desert
growths lay between, and much of brown desert yet to
cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make the foothills tonight even though
there is an early moon,&rdquo; decided Kit. &ldquo;But we can break
camp at dawn and make it before the sun is high, and the
water will hold out that long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will hold for Buntin&rsquo; and the mules, but what of
Pardner?&rdquo; asked the older man. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not used to this
hard pan gravel scratching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s thoroughbred, and he can stand it twelve
hours more if I can, can&rsquo;t you, old pal?&rdquo; The tall roan
with the dot of black between the eyes returned his
owner&rsquo;s caress by nosing his bare neck, and the hand
held up to smooth the black mane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad enough to see him safe across the border
in old Arizona,&rdquo; observed Pike. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how the
herders saved him for you at Mesa Blanca when their
own stock was picked of its best for the various patriots
charging through the settlements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some way, Miguel, the Indian vaquero, managed it,
or got his girl to hide it out. Whitely confessed that his
Indian cattlemen are the most loyal he can find down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not a white man&rsquo;s land&ndash;&ndash;yet, and I&rsquo;m downright
glad he&rsquo;s shipped his family north. There&rsquo;s always
hell enough in Sonora, but it&rsquo;s a dovecote to what it&rsquo;s
bound to be before the end comes, and so, it&rsquo;s no place for
white men&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are! Say, what was it Whitely heard down
in Sinaloa concerning the Enchanted Ca&ntilde;on mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some old priest&rsquo;s tale&ndash;&ndash;the same dope we got
with a different slant to it. The gold nuggets from some
shrine place where the water gushed <i>muy fuerte</i>, by a
sycamore tree. Same old nuggets sent out with the message,
and after that the insurrection of the Indians, and
the priests who found it never lived to get out. Why,
Bub, that is nearly two hundred years ago! Stop and
think of the noble Castilians going over Sonora with a
fine tooth comb for that trail ever since and then think of
the nerve of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m nearer to it anyway than the Dutchman
who trekked in from the south last year with copies of
the old mission reports as guide, for the Yaquis killed
him, and took his records, while they hide my horse for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! yes, and warn you to ride him north!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct;&ndash;&ndash;but Pike, it was a warning, not a threat!
Oh, I&rsquo;m coming back all right, all right! That gold by
the hidden stream sure has got me roped and hog tied
for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pike growled good-natured disdain of his confidence,
and suggested that the stream, which was probably only a
measly mud hole, could have dropped to purgatory in an
earthquake tremor since those first old mission days, or
filled up with quicksand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Cap. That&rsquo;s a first-rate idea,&rdquo; agreed
Kit the irrepressible. &ldquo;Next trip we&rsquo;ll start looking for
streams that were and are not; we&rsquo;re in the bed of one
now for that matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere ahead we should come into the trail south
from Carracita,&rdquo; observed Pike, &ldquo;but I reckon you&rsquo;d just
as soon camp with Pard out of sight of the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a bit as they plodded on up the
wide dry bed of the river, and then Kit turned, glancing
at the old man keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fool you much when I called that gang
&lsquo;vaqueros,&rsquo; did I?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t
look good to me, and I decided I&rsquo;d have to fight for my
horse if we crossed trails, and&ndash;&ndash;it wastes a lot of time,
fighting does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t fool me. You&rsquo;d be seven kinds of an
idiot to walk in this gully of purgatory when you could
ride safely on the mesa above, so I guessed you had a
hunch it was the friendly and acquisitive patriots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pike, they were between us and the Palomitas
rancherias of Mesa Blanca or I&rsquo;d have made a try to get
through and warn the Indians there. Those men had no
camp women with them, so they were not a detachment of
the irregular cavalry,&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s what puzzles me. And
their horses were fresh. It&rsquo;s some new devilment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing new in Sonora, son. Things happen
over and over the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadows lengthened, and the blue range to the east
had sharp, black edges against the saffron sky, and the
men plodding along over sand and between boulders, fell
silent after the little exchange of confidence as to choice
of trail. Once Kit left the gully and climbed the steep
grade to the mesa alone to view the landscape over, but
slid and scrambled down,&ndash;&ndash;hot, dusty, and vituperative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sign of life but some carrion crows moving
around in the blue without flop of a wing,&rdquo; he grumbled.
&ldquo;Who started the dope that mankind is the chosen of the
Lord? Huh! we have to scratch gravel for all we rake
in but the birds of the air have us beat for desert travel
all right, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bub, if you saw no one&rsquo;s dust it must be that
gang were not headed for Palomitas or Whitely&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could strike Palomitas, and circle over to the
east road without striking Whitely&rsquo;s home corrals,&rdquo; said
Kit thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they could, but what&rsquo;s the object? If it&rsquo;s cattle
or horses they&rsquo;re after the bigger ranch is the bigger
haul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;if it&rsquo;s stock they&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; agreed Kit somberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, lad, what&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s got you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s the damned buzzards,&rdquo; acknowledged the
younger man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what struck me as I sat
up there watching them. Maybe it&rsquo;s their blackness,
maybe it&rsquo;s their provender, maybe it was just the loco of
their endless drifting shadows, but for a minute up there
I had an infernal sick feeling. It&rsquo;s a new one on me, and
there was nothing I could blame it on but disgust of the
buzzards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; too shy on the water, and never knew
before that you had nerves,&rdquo; stated Pike sagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been there; fought with a pardner once,&ndash;&ndash;Jimmy Dean,
till he had to rope me. You take a pull at the water
bottle, and take it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit did so, but shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It touches the right spot, but it was not a thirst
fancy. It was another thought and&ndash;&ndash;O Bells of Pluto!
Pike, let&rsquo;s talk of something else! What was that you
said about the Sinaloa priest story of the red gold? You
said something about a new slant on the old dope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh!&rdquo; grunted Pike. &ldquo;At least it was a new
slant to me. I&rsquo;ve heard over and over about uprising of
Indians, and death of the two priests who found their
mine, but this Sinaloa legend has it that the Indians did
not kill the priests, but that their gods did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their gods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, the special gods of that region rose up and
smote them. That&rsquo;s why the Indians barred out other
mission priests for so long a spell that no white man
remembered just where the lost shrine of the red gold
was. Of course it&rsquo;s all punk, Bub, just some story of the
heathen sheep to hide the barbecuing of their shepherds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but I&rsquo;ve as much curiosity as a pet coon.
What special process did their gods use to put the friars
out of commission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lightning. The original priests&rsquo; report had it that
the red gold was at some holy place of the tribes, a shrine
of some sort. Well, you know the usual mission rule&ndash;&ndash;if
they can&rsquo;t wean the Indian from his shrine, they
promptly dig foundations and build a church there under
heavenly instructions. That&rsquo;s the story of this shrine of
El Alisal where the priests started to build a little branch
chapel or <i>visita</i>, for pious political reasons&ndash;&ndash;and built it
at the gold shrine. It went down in the priests&rsquo; letter
or record as gold of rose, a deep red gold. Well, under
protest, the Indians helped build a shack for a church
altar under a great aliso tree there, but when lightning
struck the priests, killed both and burned the shack, you
can see what that manifestation would do to the Indian
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit halted, panting from the heart-wearying trail, and
looked Pike over disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy mackerel! Pike, haven&rsquo;t you <i>any</i> imagination?
You&rsquo;ve had this new side to the story for over a month
and never even cheeped about it! I heard you and
Whitely talking out on the porch, but I didn&rsquo;t hear this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bub, it&rsquo;s just the same old story, everyone of
them have half a dozen different sides to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one explains things, this one has logic, this
one blazes a trail!&rdquo; declared the enthusiast. &ldquo;This one
explains good and plenty why no Indian has ever cheeped
about it, no money could bribe him to it. Can&rsquo;t you see?
Of course that lightning was sent by their wrathy gods,
of course it was! But do you note that place of the gold,
and place of the shrine where the water rises, is also some
point where there is a dyke of iron ore near, a magnet
for the lightning? And that is not here in those sandy
mesas and rocky barrancas&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s to the west in the hills,
Pike. Can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too far from the old north and south trail, Bub.
There was nothing to take padres so far west to the hills.
The Indians didn&rsquo;t even live there; only strayed up for
nuts and hunting in the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath!&rdquo; jeered Kit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me to hike
back to Mesa Blanca and offer service at fifty dollars per,
and live like a miser until we can hit the trail again. I
may find a tenderfoot to buy that valley tract of mine up
in Yuma, and get cash out of that. Oh, we will get the
finances somehow! I&rsquo;ll write a lawyer soon as we get
back to Whitely&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;God! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They halted, holding breath to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coyote,&rdquo; said Pike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only one animal screams like that&ndash;&ndash;a wildcat
in the timber. But it&rsquo;s no wildcat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the sound came. It was either from a distance
or else muffled by the barrier of the hill, a blood-curdling
scream of sickening terror.</p>
<p>A cold chill struck the men as they looked at each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carrion crows knew!&rdquo; said Kit. &ldquo;You hold the
stock, Pike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quickly slipped his rifle from its case, and started
up the knoll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stock will stand,&rdquo; said Pike. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two men ran upward to the summit and away
from the crunching of their own little outfit in the bed of
the dry river, they were struck by the sound of clatter
of hoofs and voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bub, do you know where we are?&rdquo; asked Pike&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;this
draw slants south and has brought us fair into the
Palomitas trail where it comes into the old Yaqui trail,
and on south to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell it is, if it&rsquo;s the slavers again after women,&rdquo;
said Kit. &ldquo;Come quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the summit where cacti and greasewood
served as shield, and slightly below them they saw, against
the low purple hills, clouds of dust making the picture
like a vision and not a real thing, a line of armed horsemen
as outpost guards, and men with roped arms
stumbling along on foot slashed at occasionally with a
<i>reata</i> to hasten their pace. Women and girls were there,
cowed and drooping, with torn garments and bare feet.
Forty prisoners in all Kit counted of those within range,
ere the trail curved around the bend of a hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that scream?&rdquo; muttered Kit. &ldquo;All those women
are silent as death, but that scream?&rdquo; Then he saw.</p>
<p>One girl was in the rear, apart from the rest of the
group. A blond-bearded man spurred his horse against
her, and a guard lashed at her to keep her behind. Her
scream of terror was lest she be separated from that most
woeful group of miserables. The horse was across the
road, blocking it, as the man with the light beard slid
from the saddle and caught her.</p>
<p>Kit&rsquo;s gun was thrown into position as Pike caught his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look at her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the Indian girl was quicker far. From the belt of
her assailant she grasped a knife and lunged at his face
as he held her. His one hand went to his cheek where
the blood streamed, and his other to his revolver.</p>
<p>But even there she was before him, for she held the
knife in both hands against her breast, and threw herself
forward in the haze of dust.</p>
<p>The other guard dismounted and stared at the still
figure on the trail, then kicked her over until he could see
her face. One look was enough. He jerked the knife
from the dead body, wiped it on her <i>manta</i>, and turned
to tie a handkerchief over the cheek of the wounded
horseman.</p>
<p>Kit muttered an oath of horror, and hastily drew the
field glass from its case to stare at the man whose beard,
a false one, had been torn off in the struggle. It was not
easy to re-adjust it so that it would not interfere with the
bandage, and thus he had a very fair view of the man&rsquo;s
features, and his thoughts were of Billie&rsquo;s words to Conrad
concerning slave raids in Sonora. Had Billie really
suspected, or had she merely connected his Mexican
friends with reports of raids for girls in the little Indian
pueblos?</p>
<p>Pike reached for the glass, but by the time he could
focus it to fit his eyes, the man had re-mounted, riding
south, and there was only the dead girl left there where
she fell, an Indian girl they both knew, Anita, daughter
of Miguel, the major-domo of Mesa Blanca, whose own
little rancheria was with the Pimans at Palomitas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look above, Cap,&rdquo; said Kit.</p>
<p>Above two pair of black wings swept in graceful curves
against the saffron sky&ndash;&ndash;waiting!</p>
<p>Rhodes went back to the outfit for pick and shovel,
and when twilight fell they made a grave there in the
dusky ca&ntilde;on of the desert.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE SLAVE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>They camped that night in the barranca, and next
morning a thin blue smoke a mile away drew Kit
out on the roan even in the face of the heat to be, and
the water yet to find. He hoped to discover someone
who had been more fortunate in escape.</p>
<p>He found instead an Indian he knew, one whose gray
hair was matted with blood and who stood as if dazed by
terror at sound of hoofs. It was Miguel, the Pima head
man of Mesa Blanca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miguel, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>The eyes of the man had a strange look, and he did
not answer. But he did move hesitatingly to the horse
and stroked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caballo,</i>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>Muy bueno, caballo.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Pardner&rsquo;s rider, &ldquo;very good always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i> se&ntilde;or, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit swung from the saddle, and patted the old man&rsquo;s
shoulder. He was plainly dazed from either a hurt, or
shock, and would without doubt die if left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, you ride, and we&rsquo;ll go to camp, then find
water,&rdquo; suggested Kit. &ldquo;Camp here no good. Come
help me find water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That appeal penetrated the man&rsquo;s mind more clearly.
Miguel had been the well-trusted one of the Indian
vaqueros, used to a certain dependence put upon him,
and he straightened his shoulders for a task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i> se&ntilde;or, a good padrone are you, and water it will
be found for you.&rdquo; He was about to mount when he
halted, bewildered, and looked about him as if in search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&ndash;&ndash;my people&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said brokenly. &ldquo;My children
of me&ndash;&ndash;my child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit knew that his most winning child lay newly covered
under the sand and stones he had gathered by moonlight
to protect the grave from coyotes.</p>
<p>But there was a rustle back of him and a black-eyed
elf, little more than a child, was standing close, shaking
the sand from her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hearing you speak. I know it is you, and I
come,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was Tula, the younger daughter of Miguel,&ndash;&ndash;one
who had carried them water from the well on her steady
head, and played with the babies on the earthen floors at
the pueblo of Palomitas.</p>
<p>But the childish humors were gone, and her face wore
the Indian mask of any age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at Palomitas. I was in the willows by the well
when they came, Juan Gonsalvo and El Aleman, and
strange soldiers. All the women scream and make battle,
also the men, and that is when my father is hurt in the
head, that is when they are taking my mother, and Anita,
my sister. Some are hiding. And El Aleman and Juan
Gonsalvo make the count, and sent the men for search.
That is how it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say El Aleman?&rdquo; asked Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seeing him other time with Don Jos&eacute;, and hearing
how he talk. Also Anita knowing him, and scream his
name&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Don Adolf!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;when he catch her. Juan Gonsalvo
has a scarf tied over the face&ndash;&ndash;all but the eyes, but
the Don Adolf has the face now covered with hairs and
I seeing him. They take all the people. My father is
hurt, but lives. He tries to follow and is much sick. My
mother is there, and Anita, my sister, is there. He thinks
it better to find them&ndash;&ndash;it is his head is sick. He walks
far beside me, and does not know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She showed him a few grains of parched corn tied up
in the corner of her <i>manta</i>. &ldquo;Water I have, and roots
of the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; repeated Miguel mechanically. &ldquo;Yes, I am
the one who knows where it comes. I am the one to
show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the girl met Kit&rsquo;s gaze of understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hurt is of his head,&rdquo; she stated again. &ldquo;In the
night he made speech of strange old-time things, secret
things, and of fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Well, it was a bad night for old men and Indian
girls in the desert. Let&rsquo;s be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula picked up her hidden wicker water bottle and
trudged on sandaled feet beside Kit. Miguel went into a
heap in the saddle, dazed, muttering disjointed Indian
words, only one was repeated often enough to make an
impression,&ndash;&ndash;it was Cajame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Cajame?&rdquo; he asked the girl, and she gave
him a look of tolerance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was of chiefs the most great. He was killed for
his people. He was the father of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit tried to recall where he had heard the name, but
failed. No one had chanced to mention that Miguel, the
peaceful Piman, had any claims on famous antecedents.
He had always seemed a grave, silent man, intent only on
herding the stock and caring for the family, at the little
cluster of adobes by the well of Palomitas. It was about
two miles from the ranch house, but out of sight. An
ancient river hill terminated in a tall white butte at the
junction of two arroyas, and the springs feeding them
were the deciding influence regarding location of dwellings.
Rhodes could quickly perceive how a raid could
be made on Palomitas and, if no shots were fired, not be
suspected at the ranch house of Mesa Blanca.</p>
<p>The vague sentences of Miguel were becoming more
connected, and Kit, holding him in the saddle, was much
puzzled by some of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, and we are yet dying,&rdquo; he muttered as he
swayed in the saddle. &ldquo;We, the Yaqui, are yet dumb as
our fathers bade. But it is the end, se&ntilde;or, and the red
gold of Alisal is our own, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his voice dwindled away in mutterings and
Rhodes saw that the Indian girl was very alert, but
watching him rather than her father as she padded along
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it&ndash;&ndash;Alisal?&rdquo; he asked carelessly, and her
velvet-black eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not anyone is knowing. It is also evil to
speak of that place,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes the evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so the padres. I no knowing, what you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they had reached the place of camp where Cap
Pike had the packs on the animals, waiting and restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a great little collector, Bub,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;You start out on the bare sand and gravel and raise a
right pert family. Who&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his cynical comment, he was brisk enough with
help when Miguel slid to the ground, ashen gray, and
senseless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are up against trouble, with an old cripple
and a petticoat to tote, and water the other side of the
range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he poured a little of the precious fluid down the
throat of the Indian, who recovered, but stared about
vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said nodding his head when his eyes
rested on Rhodes, &ldquo;as you say&ndash;&ndash;it is for the water&ndash;&ndash;as
you say&ndash;&ndash;it is the end&ndash;&ndash;for the Yaqui. Dead is Cajame&ndash;&ndash;die
all we by the Mexican! To you, se&ntilde;or, my child,
and El Alisal of the gold of the rose. So it will be,
se&ntilde;or. It is the end&ndash;&ndash;the water is there, se&ntilde;or. It is
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; remarked Pike, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone loony and
talking of old chief Cajame of the Yaquis. He was
hanged by the Mexican government for protesting against
loot by the officials. A big man he was, nothing trifling
about Cajame! That old Indian had eighty thousand in
gold in a government bank. Naturally the Christian
rulers couldn&rsquo;t stand for that sort of shiftlessness in a
heathen! Years ago it was they burned him out, destroyed
his house and family;&ndash;&ndash;the whole thing was
hellish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl squatting in the sand, never took her eyes off
Pike&rsquo;s face. It was not so much the words, but the tone
and expression she gave note to, and then she arose and
moved over beside her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said stolidly, &ldquo;it is his families here, Yaqui
me&ndash;&ndash;no Pima! Hiding he was when young, hiding with
Pima men all safe. The padre of me is son to Cajame,&ndash;&ndash;only
to you it is told, you Americano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were pitiful in their strained eagerness, striving
with all her shocked troubled soul to read the faces
of the two men, and staking all her hopes of safety in
her trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we&rsquo;re Americano, Tula, and so will you be
when we get you over the border,&rdquo; stated Rhodes recklessly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we are going to do it, Cap,
but I swear I&rsquo;m not going to let a plucky little girl
like that go adrift to be lifted by the next gang of raiders.
We need a mascot anyway, and she is going to be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice sort of seasoned veteran, Bub,&rdquo; admitted
Pike dryly, &ldquo;but in adopting a family it might be
as well to begin with a he mascot instead of what you&rsquo;ve
picked. A young filly like that might turn hoodoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d have halted for a sober second thought if
it hadn&rsquo;t been for that other girl under the stones down
there,&rdquo; agreed Rhodes. &ldquo;But shucks!&ndash;&ndash;with all the
refugees we&rsquo;re feeding across the line where&rsquo;s the obstacle
to this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old prospector was busy with the wounded head
for the Indian and had no reply ready, but shook his head
ominously. Rhodes scowled and began uncoiling a <i>reata</i>
in case it would be needed to tie Miguel in the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get some hustle to this outfit,&rdquo; he observed
glancing at the sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far to take them
back to Whitely&rsquo;s, and water has to be had. We are
really nearer to Soledad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl came closer to him, speaking in a low,
level manner, strange and secretive, yet not a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does know&ndash;&ndash;and water is there at that place,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;In the night I am hearing him speak all what
the ancients hide. He no can walk to that place, maybe I
no can walk, but go you for the gold in the hidden ca&ntilde;on.
You are Americano,&ndash;&ndash;strong,&ndash;&ndash;is it not? A brave heart
and much of gold of rose would bring safe again the
mother of me and my sister! All this I listen to in the
night. For them the gold of rose by the hidden water is
to be uncovered again. But see, his hands are weak, his
head is like the <i>ni&ntilde;o</i> in the reed basket. A stronger heart
must find the way&ndash;&ndash;it is you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lowly, haltingly, she kept on that level-voiced decision.
It was evident that the ravings of her father
through the long hours of the dreadful night had filled
her mind with his one desire: to dare the very gods
that the red gold might be uncovered again, and purchase
freedom for the Indians on the exile road to the coast.</p>
<p>So low were her words that even Cap Pike, a rod away,
only heard the voice, but not the subject. It was further
evident that she meant but the one man to hear. Pike
had white hair and to her mind was, like her father, to
be protected from responsibilities, but Rhodes loomed
strong and kind, and braced by youth for any task.</p>
<p>Rhodes looked at her pityingly, and patted her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re all a little loco, kid,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so paralyzed with the hell you saw, and his
ravings that you think his dope of the gold is all gospel,
but it&rsquo;s only a dream, sister,&ndash;&ndash;a sick man&rsquo;s fancy, though
you sure had me going for a minute, plum hypnotized
by the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to hide always,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No man must know.
No other eyes must see, only you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promising all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure again! Just to comfort you I promise that
when I find the gold of El Alisal I will use it to help get
your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;Half to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half it is! You&rsquo;re a great little planner for your
size, kid. Too bad it&rsquo;s only a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap Pike rose to his feet, and gave a hand to Miguel,
who reeled, and then steadied himself gradually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most thanks, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and when we
reach the water&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They helped him into the saddle, and Rhodes walked
beside, holding him as he swayed.</p>
<p>They passed the new-made grave in the sand, and
Rhodes turned to the girl. &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lift two
stones and add to that pile there, one for you and one
for your father. Also look around and remember this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no forgetting it,&rdquo; she said as she lifted a stone
and placed it as he told her. &ldquo;It is here the exile trail.
I mark the place where you take for me the Americano
road, and not the south road of the lost. So it is,&ndash;&ndash;these
stone make witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be shot if I don&rsquo;t believe you <i>are</i> old Cajames
stock,&rdquo; said Cap Pike staring at her, and then meeting
the gaze of Rhodes in wonder at her clear-cut summing
up of the situation. &ldquo;But he was a handful for the government
in his day, Bub, and I&rsquo;m hornswaggled if I&rsquo;d
pick out his breed for a kindergarten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl heard and understood at least the jocular tenor
of his meaning, but no glance in his direction indicated
it. She placed the second stone, and then in obedience
to Rhodes she looked back the way she had come where
the desert growth crisped in the waves of heat. On one
side lay the low, cactus-dotted hillocks, and on the other
the sage green and dull yellow faded into the blue mists
of the eastern range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no forgetting it, this place ever,&rdquo; she said and
then lifted her water bottle and trudged on beside Rhodes.
&ldquo;It is where my trail begins, with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cape Pike grinned at the joke on the boy, for it looked
as if the Yaqui girl were adopting <i>him</i>!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A MEETING AT YAQUI WELL</h3>
</div>
<p>Good luck was with them, for the water hole in
Yaqui ca&ntilde;on had not been either muddied or exhausted,
evidence that the raiders had not ranged that
way. The sorry looking quartette fairly staggered into
the little ca&ntilde;on, and the animals were frantic with desire
to drink their fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so near fried that the first gallon fairly sizzled
down my gullet,&rdquo; confessed Cap Pike after a long glorious
hour of rest under the alamos with saturated handkerchief
over his burning eyes. &ldquo;That last three mile stretch
was hell&rsquo;s back yard for me. How you reckon the little
trick over there ever stood it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl was resting near her father, and every
little while putting water on his face and hands. When
she heard the voice of Pike she sat up, and then started
quietly to pick up dry yucca stalks and bits of brushwood
for a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that, would you, Bub,&rdquo; commented Pike,
&ldquo;the minute she sees you commence to open the cook kit
she is rustling for firewood. That little devil is made
of whalebone for toughness. Why, even the burros are
played out, but she is fresh as a daisy after a half hour&rsquo;s
rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes noted that the excitement by which she had
been swayed to confidence in the morning had apparently
burned out on the trail, for she spoke no more, only
served silently as generations of her mothers of the desert
had done, and waited, crouched back of her father, while
the men ate the slender meal of <i>carne seco</i>, <i>atole</i>, and
coffee.</p>
<p>Cap Pike suggested that she join them, but it was her
adopted guardian who protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t change their ways of women,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;I notice that when white folks try to they are seldom
understood. How do we know whether that attitude is
an humble effacement, or whether the rank of that martyred
ancester exalts her too greatly to allow equality
with white stragglers of the range?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap Pike snorted disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be making a Pocahontas of her if you keep on
that &lsquo;noble Injun&rsquo; strain,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me! Pocahontas was a gay little
hanger-on of the camps,&ndash;&ndash;not like this silent owl! Her
mind seems older than her years, and just notice her
care of him, will you? I reckon he&rsquo;d have wandered
away and died but for her grip on him through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miguel sank into sleep almost at once after eating, and
the girl waved over him an alamo branch as a fan with
one hand, and ate with the other, while Rhodes looked
over the scant commissary outfit, reckoning mouths to
feed and distance to supplies. The moon was at full,
and night travel would save the stock considerably. By
the following noon they could reach ranches either west
or north. He was conscious of the eyes of the girl ever
on his face in mute question, and while Pike bathed the
backs of the animals, and led each to stand in the oozy
drainage of the meager well, she came close to Kit and
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is a dream, se&ntilde;or, and you laugh, but the
red gold of El Alisal is no dream. He, my father has said
it, and after that, I, Tula, may show it to you. Even my
mother does not know, but I know. I am of the blood to
know. You will take him there, for it is a medicine place,
much medicine! He has said it to you, se&ntilde;or, and that
gift is great. You will come, alone,&ndash;&ndash;with us, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit smiled at her entreaty, patted her hair, and dug
out a worn deck of cards and shuffled them, slowly regarding
the sleeping Indian the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; demanded Cap Pike, returning
with his white locks dripping from a skimpy bath.
&ldquo;Our grub stake is about gone, and you&rsquo;ve doubled the
outfit. What&rsquo;s the next move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing a game in futures with Miguel,&rdquo; stated
Kit, shuffling the cards industriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds loco to me, Bub,&rdquo; observed the veteran.
&ldquo;Present indications are not encouraging as to futures
there. Can&rsquo;t you see that he&rsquo;s got a jar from which his
mind isn&rsquo;t likely to recover? Not crazy, you know, not
a lunatic or dangerous, but just jarred from Pima man
back to Yaqui child. That&rsquo;s about the way I reckon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reckon right, and it&rsquo;s the Yaqui child mind I&rsquo;m
throwing the cards for. Best two out of three wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highest cards for K. Rhodes, and I hike across the
border with our outfit; highest cards for Miguel and my
trail is blazed for the red gold of Alisal. This is Miguel&rsquo;s
hand&ndash;&ndash;ace high for Miguel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he shuffled and cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A saucy queen, and red at that! Oh, you charmer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got to hustle to beat that, Bub. Go on, don&rsquo;t
be stingy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes cut the third time, then stared and whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cards are stacked by the Indian! All three covered
with war paint. What&rsquo;s the use in a poor stray
white bucking against that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked out the cards and placed them side by side,
ace, king and queen of hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three aces could beat them,&rdquo; suggested Pike. &ldquo;Go
on Bub, shuffle them up, don&rsquo;t be a piker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes did, and cut ten of clubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even the right color,&rdquo; he lamented. &ldquo;Nothing
less than two aces for salvation, and I&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;get&ndash;&ndash;them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lonely deuce fell on the sand, and Rhodes eyed it
sulkily as he rolled a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor little runt,&rdquo; he apostrophized the harmless
two-spot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kicked me out of the frying pan into
the fire, and a good likely blaze at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reckon I care to go any deeper into trouble
than what we&rsquo;ve found,&rdquo; decided Pike. &ldquo;Ordinary Indian
scraps are all in the day&rsquo;s work&ndash;&ndash;same with
a Mexican outfit&ndash;&ndash;but, Bub, this slave-hunting graft
game with the state soldiery doing the raiding is too
strong a combine for two lone rangers to buck against.
Me for the old U.&nbsp;S. border, and get some of this devilish
word to the peace advocates at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t believe you, and only about two papers
along the border would dare print it,&rdquo; observed Rhodes.
&ldquo;Every time a band of sunny Mexicans loot a ranch or
steal women, the word goes north that again the bloodthirsty
Yaquis are on the warpath! Those poor devils
never leave their fields of their own will, and don&rsquo;t know
why the Americans have a holy dread of them. Yet the
Yaqui is the best worker south of the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t the price wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the slave
trader&rsquo;s valuable time,&rdquo; commented Pike.</p>
<p>The Indian girl made a quick gesture of warning, just
a sweep outward of her hand along the ground. She
didn&rsquo;t even look at them, but down the arroya, the trail
they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caballos, hombres!</i>&rdquo; she muttered in her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s right,&ndash;&ndash;hear them!&rdquo; said Rhodes, and then
he looked at him, and made a strange movement of eyes
and head to direct the attention back of her in the
thicket of cactus and squat greasewood. He did not look
at once, but finally with a circular sweep of the locality,
he saw the light glint on a gun barrel along the edge of
a little mesa above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice friendly attention,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Someone
sizing us up. Time to hit the trail anyway, Cap;&ndash;&ndash;to get
through on the grub we have to travel tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and handed the water bottles to the girl to
fill, while he tightened cinches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long day&rsquo;s trip, Cap,&rdquo; he stated thoughtfully,
&ldquo;a long day out to Carrizal, and a long one back to Mesa
Blanca. I&rsquo;ll divide the dust and the grub fifty-fifty, and
you get out to some base of supplies. I&rsquo;d rather you&rsquo;d
take Pardner, and keep on going across the line. The
trail is clear from here for you, and enough water holes
and settlements for you to get through. I don&rsquo;t think
Pardner would last for the back trip, but you can save him
by riding at night; the burro and mule are best for us.
Here&rsquo;s the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Pike had been talking of crossing the border,
Kit had been rapidly readjusting the provision so that
the old chap had enough to carry him to the first settlement,
and the gold dust would more than pay for provision
the rest of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;say, Bub!&rdquo; remonstrated Pike. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so
sudden! I don&rsquo;t allow to leave you by your lonesomes
like this. Why, I had planned&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to do,&rdquo; decided Rhodes crisply.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t beat it with Pardner, we&rsquo;ll lose him, sure!
I&rsquo;m going to take these Indians back, and you can help
most by waiting north of the line till you hear from me.
I&rsquo;ll get word to you at Granados. So, if there should be
any trouble with these visitors of ours, your trail is
clear;&ndash;&ndash;savvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men rode into view in the bend of the arroya. A
cartridge belt across each shoulder, and one around each
waist, was the most important part of their equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos dias</i>, se&ntilde;ors,&rdquo; said one politely, while his little
black eyes roved quickly over the group. &ldquo;Is there
still water to be found in the well here? <i>Dios!</i> it is the
heat of hell down there in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;or, is water fresh drawn,&rdquo; said
Rhodes, and turned to the girl, &ldquo;Oija, Tulita!&ndash;&ndash;water
for the gentlemen. You ride far, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Soledad wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the brand,&rdquo; remarked Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good season in which to avoid too much
knowledge, or too good a memory, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; observed the
man who had not spoken. &ldquo;Many herds will change hands
without markets before tranquility is over in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, se&ntilde;or, and we who have nothing will
be the lucky ones,&rdquo; agreed Rhodes, regarding the man
with a new interest. He was not handsome, but there
was a something quick and untamed in his keen, black
eyes, and though the mouth had cruel hard lines, his tone
was certainly friendly, yet dominating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you here?&rdquo; he asked with a gesture toward
Miguel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Indian who tried to save his women from slavers,
and was left for dead,&rdquo; stated Rhodes frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the girl filling again the water bottles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is mine, se&ntilde;or. We go to our own homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! you should be enlisted in the fights and become
capitan, but these would drop by the trail if you left
them. Well, another time perhaps, se&ntilde;or! For the
water many thanks. <i>Adios!</i>&rdquo; and with wave of the hand
they clattered down the arroya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; muttered Rhodes, &ldquo;did you catch that second
chap signal to the gun man in the cactus? He craw-fished
back over the mesa and faded away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t come for water alone&ndash;&ndash;some scouten&rsquo;
party trailin&rsquo; every sign found,&rdquo; decided Pike. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bet they had us circled before the two showed themselves.
Wonder who they are after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway they didn&rsquo;t think us worth while gathering
in, which is a comfort. That second fellow looks like
someone I&rsquo;ve crossed trails with, but I can&rsquo;t place him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll place you all right, all right!&rdquo; prophesied
Pike darkly, &ldquo;you and your interesting family won&rsquo;t
need a brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes stared at him a moment and then grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Cap. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be pie for the gossips
to slice up for home consumption?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept on grinning as he looked at the poor bit
of human flotsam whom he had dubbed &ldquo;the owl&rdquo; because
of her silence and her eyes. She aroused Miguel
without words, watching him keenly for faintest sign of
recovery. The food and sleep had refreshed him in body,
but the mind was far away. To the girl he gave no
notice, and after a long bewildered stare at Rhodes he
smiled in a deprecating way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Don Jos&eacute;, that I outsleep the camp,&rdquo;
he muttered haltingly. &ldquo;It is a much sickness of the
head to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that reason must you ride slowly today,&rdquo; stated
Rhodes with quick comprehension of the groping mind,
though the &ldquo;Don Jos&eacute;&rdquo; puzzled him, and at first chance
he loitered behind with the girl and questioned her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How makes itself that I must know all the people
in the world before I was here on earth?&rdquo; she asked
morosely? &ldquo;Me he does not know, Don Jos&eacute; is of Soledad
and is of your tallness, so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you the man who came for water at the ca&ntilde;on
well?&rdquo; he asked, and she looked at him quickly and
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of the man was not spoke by him, also he
said a true word of brands on herds&ndash;&ndash;these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these days?&rdquo; reflected Rhodes, amazed at the ungirlish
logic. &ldquo;You know what he meant when he
said that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We try that we know&ndash;&ndash;all we, for the Deliverer is
he named, and by that name only he is spoke in the
prayers we make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes stared at her, incredulous, yet wondering if the
dusty vaquero looking rider of brief words could be
the man who was called outlaw, heathen, and bandit by
Calendria, and &ldquo;Deliverer&rdquo; by these people of bondage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that is true;&ndash;&ndash;he will be the deliverer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not so much think, I am only remembering what the
fathers say and the mothers. Their word is that he will
be the man, if&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if what?&rdquo; he asked as she crossed herself, and
dropped her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not wanting to say that thing. It is a scare on
the heart when it is said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be prepared for the scare if it strikes me,&rdquo;
he announced, and after a thoughtful silence while she
padded along beside him, she lowered her voice as though
to hide her words from the evil fates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will I tell it you:&ndash;&ndash;a knife in the back is what
they fear for him, or poison in his cup. He is hated
by strong haters, also he makes them know fear. I hearing
all that in the patio at Palomitas, and old Tio Polonio
is often saying all saviors are crucified. How you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes replied vaguely as to the wisdom of Tio
Polonio, for the girl was giving him the point of view
of the peon, longing for freedom, yet fatalistic as the
desert born ever are. And she had known the rebel
leader, Ramon Rotil, all the time!</p>
<p>He had no doubt but that she was right. Her statement
explained the familiar appearance of the man he
had not met before, though he had seen pictures in newspapers
or magazines. Then he fell to wondering what
Ramon Rotil was doing in a territory so far from the
troops, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Jos&eacute; is one of the strong men who are hating
him much,&rdquo; confided the child. &ldquo;Also Don Jos&eacute; comes
not north alone ever anymore, always the soldiers are
his guard. Tio Polonio tells things of these soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are killing boys like rabbits in Canannea,&ndash;&ndash;pacifico
boys who could grow to Calendrista soldiers.
Such is done by the guard of Don Jos&eacute; and all the friends
of the Deliverer are killed with a quickness. That is how
the men of Don Jos&eacute; Perez please him most, and in the
south there are great generals who work also with him,
and his hand is made strong, also heavy, and that is what
Tio Polonio is telling us often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the mouth of the little ca&ntilde;on of
the Yaqui well where the trails divide, Pike shook hands
and climbed into the saddle of Pardner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I ever took the easy way out, and
left the fight alone to a chum,&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;ll do it, Bub, because
you could not make a quick get-away with me
tagging along. Things look murkier in this territory
every minute. You&rsquo;ll either have the time of your life, or
a headstone early in the game. Billie and I will put it up
though we won&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re planted. I don&rsquo;t
like it, but the minutes and water for the trail are both
precious. Come out quick as you can. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pardner, refreshed by cooling drink and an hour&rsquo;s
standing in wet mud of the well drainage, stepped off
briskly toward the north, while Rhodes lifted Tula to
the back of the pack mule, and Miguel unheeding all
plans or changes, drooped with closed eyes on the back
of the little burro. The manager of the reorganized gold-search
syndicate strode along in the blinding glare of the
high sun, herding them ahead of him, and as Pike turned
for a last look backward at a bend of the trail, the words

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A MEXICAN EAGLET</h3>
</div>
<p>The silver wheel of the moon was rolling into the
west when the Indian girl urged the mule forward,
and caught the bridle of the burro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tula?&rdquo; asked Rhodes, &ldquo;we are doing
well on the trail to Mesa Blanca; why stop here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See you anything? Know you
this place in the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked over the sand dunes and scrubby desert
growths stretching far and misty under the moon, and,
then to the rugged gray range of the mountain spur rising
to the south. They were skirting the very edge of it
where it rose abruptly from the plain; a very great gray
upthrust of granite wall beside them was like a gray
blade slanted out of the plain. He had noticed it as one
of the landmarks on the road to Mesa Blanca, and on its
face were a few curious scratchings or peckings, one a
rude sun symbol, and others of stars and waves of water.
He recalled remarking to Pike that it must have been
a prayer place for some of the old tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the place, when we reach this big rock
it means that we are nearing the border of the ranch, this
rock wall tells me that. We can be at Palomitas before
noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, and got down from the mule, &ldquo;not to
Palomitas now. Here we carry the food, and here
we hide the saddles, and the mule go free. The burro
we take, nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is a place to hide saddles here?&rdquo; and he made
gesture toward the great granite plane glistening in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place is found,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;it is better we ride
off the trail at this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did so, circling back the way they had come until
they were opposite a more broken part of the mountain
side, then she began deftly to help unsaddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break no brush and make all tracks like an Apache
on the trail,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Miguel sat silent on the burro as if asleep. He had
never once roused to give heed to the words or the
trail through the long ride. At times where the way was
rough he would mutter thanks at the help of Kit and sink
again into stupor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare that mule,&rdquo; protested Kit, but she nodded
her head as if that had been all thought out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will maybe not go far, there is grass and a very
little spring below. Come now, I show you that hidden
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up one of the packs and led the burro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t pack all this at once,&rdquo; decided Kit, who
was beginning to feel like the working partner in a
nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two times,&rdquo; said Tula, holding up her fingers, &ldquo;I
show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way, nervous, silent and in haste, as though
in fear of unseen enemies. Rhodes looked after her
irritably. He was fagged and worn out by one of the
hardest trails he had ever covered, and was in no condition
to solve the curious problems of the Indian mind,
but the girl had proven a good soldier of the desert, and
was, for the first time, betraying anxiety, so as the burro
disappeared in the blue mist, and only the faint patter
of his hoofs told the way he had gone, Kit picked up the
saddle and followed.</p>
<p>The way was rough and there was no trail, simply
stumbling between great jagged slabs hewn and tossed
recklessly by some convulsion of nature. Occasionally
dwarfed and stunted brush, odorous with the faint dew
of night, reached out and touched his face as he followed
up and up with ever the forbidding lances of granite
sharp edged against the sky. From the plain below there
was not even an indication that progress would be possible
for any human being over the range of shattered
rock, and he was surprised to turn a corner and find Tula
helping Miguel from the saddle in a little nook where
scant herbage grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in this place we camp,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is good
only to hide saddles and rest for my father. Dawn is on
the trail, and the other packs must come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have remonstrated about a return trip, but
she held up her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be, if you would live,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The eyes
of you have not yet seen what they are to see, it is not to
be told. All hiding must be with care, or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made swift pantomime of sighting along a gun
barrel at him, and even in the shadows he could fancy the
deadly half closing of her ungirlish eyes. Tula did not
play gaily.</p>
<p>Tired as he was, Kit grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hit what would be the
breeze if this fried land could stir one up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They plodded back without further converse, secured
the packs, and this time it was Rhodes who led, as there
appeared no possible way but the one they had covered.
Only once did he make a wrong turn and a sharp &ldquo;s-st&rdquo;
from the girl warned him of the mistake.</p>
<p>They found Miguel asleep, and Kit Rhodes would willingly
have sunk down beside him and achingly striven for
the same forgetfulness, but Tula relentlessly shook Miguel
awake, got him on the burro, unerringly designated the
food bag in the dark, and started again in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re some sort of Indian devil,&rdquo; decided
Kit, shouldering the bag. &ldquo;No mere mortal ever made
this trail or kept it open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times the towering walls suggested the bottom
of a well, and as another and another loomed up ahead,
he gloomily prophesied an ultimate wall, and the need of
wings.</p>
<p>Then, just as the first faint light began in the eastern
heavens, he was aware that the uneven trail was going
down and down, zig-zagging into a ravine like a great
gray bowl, and the bottom of it filled with shadows of
night.</p>
<p>The girl was staggering now with exhaustion though
she would not confess it. Once she fell, and he lifted her
thinking she was hurt, but she clung to him, shaking from
weakness, but whispering, &ldquo;<i>Pronto, pronto!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;all the swiftness the outfit can
muster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious odors came to him from the shadowy bowl, not
exactly a pleasing fragrance, yet he knew it&ndash;&ndash;But his
mind refused to work. As the trail grew wider, and
earth was under his feet instead of rock slivers and
round boulders, he discovered that he was leading the
burro, the grub sack over his shoulder, and with the other
arm was supporting the girl, who was evidently walking
with closed eyes, able to progress but not to guide herself.</p>
<p>Then there was the swish-swish of grasses about their
feet and poor Bunting snatched mouthfuls as all three
staggered downward. The light began to grow, and
somewhere in the shadowy bowl there was the most blest
sound known in the desert, the gurgle of running water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hear it&ndash;&ndash;but we can&rsquo;t believe it&ndash;&ndash;old Buntin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
muttered Kit holding the burro from steady and stubborn
attempts to break away, &ldquo;and you are just loco
enough to think you smell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly their feet struck rock again, not jagged
or slippery fragments, but solid paving, and a whiff of
faint mist drifted across his face in the gray of the first
dawn, and the burro craned his neck forward at the
very edge of a black rock basin where warm vapor struck
the nostrils like a soporific.</p>
<p>The girl roused herself at a wordless exclamation from
Rhodes, and began automatically helping Miguel from
the saddle, and stripping him to the breechcloth.</p>
<p>Kit&rsquo;s amazement startled him out of his lethargy of
exhaustion. It was light enough now to see that her
eyes were bloodshot, and her movements quick with a
final desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said and motioned towards a shelving
place in the rock, &ldquo;there&ndash;&ndash;medicine&ndash;&ndash;all quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half lifted the staggering, unconscious Indian, and
Kit, perceiving her intention, helped her with Miguel to
the shallow edge of the basin where she rolled him over
until he was submerged to the shoulder in the shallow
bath, cupping her hands she scooped water and drenched
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s warm!&rdquo; muttered Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine,&rdquo; said Tula, and staggered away.</p>
<p>How Rhodes shed his own garments and slipped into
the basin beside Miguel he never knew, only he knew he
had found an early substitute for heaven. It was warm
sulphur water,&ndash;&ndash;tonic, refreshing and infinitely soothing
to every sore muscle and every frazzled nerve. He ducked
his head in it, tossed some more over the head and shoulders
of the sleeping Indian, and then, submerged to his
arms, he promptly drifted into slumber himself.</p>
<p>He wakened to the sound of Baby Bunting pawing
around the grub pack. Hunger was his next conviction,
for the heavenly rest in the medicine bath had taken every
vestige of weariness away. He felt lethargic from the
sulphur fumes, and more sleep was an enticing thought,
yet he put it from him and got into his clothes after the
use of a handkerchief as a bath towel. Miguel still slept
and Kit bent over him in some concern, for the sleep appeared
curiously deep and still, the breath coming lightly,
yet he did not waken when lifted out of the water and
covered with a poncho in the shade of a great yucca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s some dope in these hot springs,&rdquo; decided
Kit. &ldquo;I feel top heavy myself, and won&rsquo;t trouble him
till I&rsquo;ve rustled some grub and have something to offer.
Well, Buntin&rsquo;, we are all here but the daughter of the
Glen,&rdquo; he said, rescuing the grub sack, &ldquo;and if she was
a dream and you inveigled me here by your own diabolical
powers, I&rsquo;ve a hunch this is our graveyard; we&rsquo;ll
never see the world and its vanities again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bit of the blue and scarlet on a bush above caught
his eye. It was the belt of Tula, and he went upwards
vaguely disturbed that he had drifted into ease without
question of her welfare.</p>
<p>He found her emerging from a smaller rock basin, her
one garment dripping a wet trail as she came towards
him. There was no smile in her greeting, but a look of
content, of achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleeping beyond belief! good medicine sleep, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head comprehendingly, for she had
done the impossible and had triumphed. She looked at
the sack of food he held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one place for fire, and other water is there.
Come, it is to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She struck off across the sun-bathed little grass plot
to a jumble of rock where a cool spring emerged, ran only
a few rods, and sank again out of sight. The shattered
rock was as a sponge, so completely was the water sucked
downward again. Marks of burro&rsquo;s hoofs were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby Buntin&rsquo; been prospecting while we wallowed in
the dope bath,&rdquo; said Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, maybe not,&rdquo; uttered the Indian child, if
such she could be called after the super-woman initiative
of that forbidding trail. She was down on her knees
peering at the tracks in the one little wet spot below
the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; she said enigmatically. &ldquo;That is good, much
good. It will be meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she saw him pulling dry grasses and breaking
branches of scrub growth for a fire, and she stood up
and motioned him to follow. They were in a narrow,
deep ravine separated from the main one by the miniature
plain of lush grass, a green cradle of rest in the heart of
the gray hills. She went as directly upward as the broken
rock would permit, and suddenly he followed her into a
blackened cave formed by a great granite slab thrusting itself
upwards and enduring through the ages when the
broken rock had shattered down to form an opposite wall.
And the cloud bursts of the desert had swept through, and
washed the sands clear, leaving a high black roof slanting
upwards to the summit.</p>
<p>Tula moved ahead into the far shadows. He could see
that beyond her somewhere a ray of light filtered blue, but
he halted at the entrance, puzzled at the black roof where
all the rock of the mountain was gray and white except
where mineral streaks were of reds and russets and
moldy greens. Then he put his hand up and touched
the roof and understood. Soot from ancient fires was
discernible on his hand, flakes of it fell to the floor, dry
and black, scaling off under pressure. The scales were
thick and very old, like blackened moss. He had seen
blackened rock like that in other volcanic regions, but
this was different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said Tula, and he followed the voice
through a darker shadowed bit of the way, then through
the ray of light, and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was the raised hearth of a rather
pretentious fireplace, or place of fire, for it resembled not
at all the tiny little cooking hearth of desert Indians. A
stone hatchet lay beside it, and, what was much more
surprising, two iron instruments of white man&rsquo;s manufacturing,
a wedge and a long chisel.</p>
<p>He picked up the chisel, weighed it in his hand, and
looked at the girl. He was now becoming accustomed
to the dim light and could see her eyes following his
every movement with curious questioning. There was a
tiny frowning wrinkle between her brows as if serious
matters were being decided there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Maybe someone dies
when a white friend is shown the way&ndash;&ndash;maybe I die,
who knows?&ndash;&ndash;but it is here&ndash;&ndash;El Alisal of the gold of
the rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a little gesture and moved aside, and the
chisel fell to the stone floor with a clang as Kit shouted
and dropped on his knees before an incredible thing in
the gray wall.</p>
<p>That upthrust of the rock wall had strange variety of
color, and between the granite and the gray limestone
there was a ragged rusty band of iron as a note of contrast
to the sprinkling of glittering quartz catching the
ray of light, but the quartz was sprinkled on a six inch
band of yellow&ndash;&ndash;not the usual quartz formation with
dots of color, but a deep definite yellow held together by
white crystals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red gold! it&rsquo;s the red gold!&rdquo; he said feeling the
yellow surface instinctively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, it is the red gold of El Alisal, and it is to
you,&rdquo; but her eyes were watching him hungrily as she
spoke. And something of that pathetic fear penetrated
his amazed mind, and he remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tula, only my share to me. I do the work, but
the great share is to you, that it may buy back your
mother from the slavers of the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also my sister,&rdquo; said the girl, and for the first time
she wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come! This is the time for joy. The danger
is gone, and we are at rest beside this&ndash;&ndash;why, it&rsquo;s a dream
come true, the golden dream! Come, help me cook that
we may be strong for the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She helped silently, fetching water and more sticks for
the fire.</p>
<p>There were many things to ask, but he asked no questions,
only gazed between bites and sups at the amazing
facts facing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen ores and ores in my time, but nothing like
this!&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;Why, I can &lsquo;high grade&rsquo; mule loads
of this and take it out without smelting,&rdquo; and then he
grinned at his little partner. &ldquo;We just struck it in time,&ndash;&ndash;meat
is mighty near done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty meat!&rdquo; she said nodding her head wisely.
&ldquo;Burro, big burro, wild burro! I see track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild burro? Sure, that makes it simple till we rest
up. You are one great little commissary sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He noted that the pitch of the roof towards the face
of the mountain carried the smoke in a sort of funnel
to be sifted through high unseen crannies of shattered
rock above. All was dark in the end of the gallery, but a
perceptible draught from the portal bore the smoke upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too good to be true,&rdquo; he decided, looking it over.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m chewing bacon and it tastes natural, but I&rsquo;m betting
with myself that this is a dream, and I&rsquo;ll wake up in the
dope pond with my mouth full of sulphur water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl watched him gravely, and ate sparingly,
though parched corn had been her only sustenance
through the trail of the dreadful night. Her poor sandals
were almost cut from her feet, and even while jesting
at the unreality of it all, Kit was making mental note of
her needs&ndash;&ndash;the wild burro would at least provide green
hide sandals for her until better could be found, and she
had earned the best.</p>
<p>He was amazed at her keenness. She did not seem to
think, but instinctively to feel her way to required knowledge,
caring for herself in the desert as a fledgling bird
tossed by some storm from the home nest. He remembered
there were wild burros in the Sonora hills, but
that she should have already located one on this most
barren of mountains was but another unbelievable touch
to the trail of enchantment, and after a century of lost
lives and treasure in the search for the Indian mine, to
think that this Indian stray, picked up on a desolate trail,
should have been the one to know that secret and lead
him to it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other times you have been here?&rdquo; he asked as he
poured coffee in a tin for Miguel, and dug out the last
box of crackers from the grub pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I come, one time, and it was to make prayer
here. It is mine to know, but not my mother, not other
peoples, only the father of me and me. If I die then he
show the trail to other one, not if I live. That is how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely picked the right member of his honorable
family,&rdquo; decided Kit. &ldquo;Only once over the trail, once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowing it long before I see it,&rdquo; she explained
gravely. &ldquo;The father of me make that trail in the sand
for my eyes when I am only little. I make the same for
him in a game to play. When I make every turn right,
and name the place, and never forget&ndash;&ndash;then he bring me,
for it is mine to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; cats!&rdquo; muttered Rhodes, eyeing her in wonder.
&ldquo;The next time I see an Indian kid playing in the
sand, I&rsquo;ll linger on the trail and absorb wisdom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you not seeing the one enchant
look, the&ndash;&ndash;how you say?&ndash;&ndash;the not believe look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take it from me, Cinderella, I&rsquo;m seeing not believe
things this very now,&rdquo; announced Kit, giving a fond
look towards that comforting gleam of yellow metal bedding
flecks of quartz. &ldquo;I see it, but will have to sleep,
and wake up to find it in the same place before I can believe
what I think I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the food and drink for Miguel in his hands he
had followed the girl through the shadowed gallery of
the slanting smoke-stained roof. His eyes were mainly
directed to the rock floor lest he stumble and spill the
precious coffee; thus he gave slight thought to the little
ravine up which she had led him to the cave which was
also a mine.</p>
<p>But as he stepped out into the sunlight she stood looking
up into his face with almost a smile, the first he had
seen in her wistful tragic eyes. Then she lifted her
hand and pointed straight out, and the &ldquo;enchant look,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;not believe&rdquo; look was there! He stared as at a
mirage for an incredulous moment, and then whispered,
&ldquo;Great God of the Desert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a little space, a few rods only, the mountain dipped
steeply, and trickling water from above fell in little cascades
to lower levels, where a great jagged wall of impregnable
granite arose as a barrier along the foot of
the mountain.</p>
<p>But he was above the sharp outline of the huge saw
with the jagged granite teeth, and between the serrated
edges he could look far across the yellow-gray reaches
of sand and desert growths. Far and wide was the &ldquo;not
believe&rdquo; look, to the blue phantom-like peaks on the
horizon, but between the two ranges was a white line
with curious dots drifting and whirling like flies along it,
and smoke curling up, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then it was he uttered the incredulous cry, for he was
indeed viewing the thing scarce to be believed.</p>
<p>He was looking across the great Rancho Soledad, and
the white line against the sand was the wall of the old
mission where the vaqueros were herding a band of
horses into the great quadrangle of the one-time patio
turned into a corral since the buildings on three sides had
melted down again into mother earth.</p>
<p>He remembered riding around these lines of the old
arches seeking trace of that door of the legend,&ndash;&ndash;the door
from which the aliso tree of the mine could be seen,&ndash;&ndash;and
there was nowhere a trace of a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer that every other part of the prospect developed
according to specifications and not the door,&rdquo; he grumbled
whimsically. &ldquo;Cinderella, why have you hid the door
in the wall from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around uncertainly, not understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No portal but it,&rdquo; she said with a movement of her
head towards the great slab forming a pointed arch against
the mountain and shielding the unbelievable richness
there, &ldquo;also El Alisal, the great tree, is gone. This was
the place of it; the old ones tell my father it was as chief
of the trees and stand high to be seen. The sky fire took
it, and took the padres that time they make an altar in
this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; assented Kit, noting traces of ancient charcoal
where the aliso tree had grown great in the moisture of
the spring before lightning had decided its tragic finish,
&ldquo;a great storm it must have been to send sky fire enough
to kill them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tula quietly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;also there was already
another shrine at this place, and the gods near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at her quickly and away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;sure, that&rsquo;s how it must have been.
They destroyed the aliso and there was no other landmark
to steer by. White men might find a thousand other
dimples in the range but never this one, the saw-tooth
range below us has the best of them buffaloed. Come
along, Se&ntilde;orita Aladdin, and help me with the guardian
of the treasure. We&rsquo;ve got to look after Miguel, and
then start in where the padres left off. And you might
do a prayer stunt or two at the shrine you mentioned.
We need all the good medicine help you can evoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they approached the pool where the faintest mist
drifted above the water warm from hidden fires of the
mountain, Kit halted before he quite reached the still form
beside the yucca, and, handing the food and drink to the
girl, he went forward alone.</p>
<p>He was puzzled afterward as to why he had done that,
for no fold of the garment was disturbed, nothing visible
to occasion doubt, yet he bent over and lifted the cover
very gently. The face of Miguel was strangely gray and
there was no longer sign of breath. The medicine of
the sacred pool had given him rest, but not life.</p>
<p>He replaced the blanket and turned to the girl;&ndash;&ndash;the
last of the guardians of the shrine of the red gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Miguel grew tired of the
trails of a hard land. He has made his choice to go
asleep here in the place where you tell me the gods are
near. He does not want us to have sad hearts, for he was
very sad and very tired, and he will not need food, Tula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears, but she made no reply, only
unbound her hair as she had seen mourning women do,
and seated herself apart, her face hidden in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is left to mourn but me, and I mourn!&rdquo; she
half chanted. &ldquo;I say it for the mother of me, and for
my sister, that the ghosts may listen. Happily he is going
now from hard trails! He has chosen at this place!
Happily he has chosen, and only we are sad. No debt
is ours to pay at this place; he has chosen&ndash;&ndash;and a life is
paid at El Alisal! Happily he will find the trail of the
birds from this place, and the trail of the clouds over the
high mountain. No one is left to mourn but me; and I
mourn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhodes understood no word of her lamentations,
chanted now loudly, now lowly, at intervals hour after
hour that day. He set grimly to work digging a grave
in the lower part of the ravine, gathering dry grass for
lining as best he could to make clear to the girl that no
lack of care or honor was shown the last man of Cajame&rsquo;s
stock.</p>
<p>The work took most of the day, for he carried stone
and built a wall around the grave and covered it with
slatelike slabs gathered from a shattered upheaval of
long ago.</p>
<p>Tula watched all this gravely, and with approval, for
she drew with her finger the mark of the sun symbol on
one of the slabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well to make that mark,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for the sons
of Cajame were priests of the sun. The sign is on the
great rock of the trail, and it is theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the chisel he carved the symbol as she suggested,
glad to do anything for the one mourner for the dead man
who had offered the treasure of the desert to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how he made choice,&rdquo; she said when it was
marked plainly. &ldquo;Me, I think he was leading us on the
night trail to this place&ndash;&ndash;I think so. He is here to guard
the gold of El Alisal for you. That is how it will be. He
has made choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit got away by himself to think over the unexpected
situation. The girl climbed to a higher point, seated herself,
and continued her chant of mourning. He knew she
was following, as best she knew, the traditional formalities
of a woman for the death of a chief. He found himself
more affected by that brave fatalistic recital, now
loud and brave, now weirdly slow and tender, than if she
had given way to tempests of tears. A man could comfort
and console a weeping stray of the desert, but not a
girl who sat with unbound hair under the yucca and called
messages to the ghosts until the sun,&ndash;&ndash;a flaming ball of
fire,&ndash;&ndash;sank beyond the far purple hills.</p>
<p>And that was the first day of many days at the hidden
treasure place of the red gold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>GLOOM OF BILLIE</h3>
</div>
<p>The return of Captain Pike on Kit&rsquo;s horse was a
matter of considerable conjecture at Granados, but
the old prospector was so fagged that at first he said
little, and after listening to the things Billie had to tell
him&ndash;&ndash;he said less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains the curious ways of the Mexicans as
I reached the border,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d look first
at the horse, then at me, but asked no questions, and told
me nothing. Queer that no word reached us about Singleton!
No, it isn&rsquo;t either. We never crossed trails
with any from up here. There&rsquo;s so much devilment of
various sorts going on down there that a harmless chap
like Singleton wouldn&rsquo;t be remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad&rsquo;s down at Magdalena now, but we seldom
know how far he ranges. Sometimes he stays at the
lower ranch a week at a time, and he might go on to
Sinaloa for all we know. He seems always busy and is
extremely polite, but I gave him the adobe house across
the arroya after Papa Phil&ndash;&ndash;went. I know he has the
Mexicans thinking Kit Rhodes came back for that murder;
half of them believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon I can prove him an alibi if it&rsquo;s needed.
I&rsquo;ll go see the old judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell you not to travel at night, or alone, if you
know anything,&rdquo; she prophesied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he tells
me. To think of old Rancho Granados coming to that
pass! We never did have trouble here except a little when
Apaches went on the warpath before my time, and now
the whole border is simmering and ready to boil over if
anyone struck a match to it. The judge hints that Conrad
is probably only one cog in the big border wheel, and
they are after the engineer who turns that wheel, and
do you know you haven&rsquo;t told me one word of Kit
Rhodes, or whether he&rsquo;s alive or dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to tell! We didn&rsquo;t find it, and he took the
back trail with an Indian girl and her daddy, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&ndash;&ndash;Indian girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a queer little kid who was in a lot of trouble.
Her father was wounded in one of the fracases they
have down there every little while. Nary one of us
could give an address when we took different trails, for
we didn&rsquo;t know how far we&rsquo;d be allowed to travel&ndash;&ndash;the
warring factions are swarming and troublesome over
the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if a girl could stand the trail, it doesn&rsquo;t look
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks are deceptive, child,&ndash;&ndash;and this isn&rsquo;t just any
old girl! It&rsquo;s a rare bird, it&rsquo;s tougher than whalebone
and possessed of a wise little devil. She froze to Kit as a
<i>compadre</i> at first chance. He headed back to Mesa
Blanca. I reckon they&rsquo;d make it,&ndash;&ndash;barring accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mesa Blanca? That&rsquo;s the Whitely outfit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; assented Pike, &ldquo;but I reckon Whitely&rsquo;s hit the
trail by now. There&rsquo;s no real profit in raising stock for
the warriors down there; each band confiscates what he
needs, and gives a promissory note on an empty treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the attraction must be pretty strong to hold
him down there in spite of conditions,&rdquo; said Billie
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attraction? Sure. Kit&rsquo;s gone loco on that attraction,&rdquo;
agreed the old prospector, and then with a reminiscent
light in his tired old eyes he added, &ldquo;I reckon
there&rsquo;s no other thing so likely to snare a man on a
desert trail. You see, Billie-child, it&rsquo;s just as if the great
God had hid a treasure in the beginning of the world to
stay hid till the right lad ambled along the trail, and lifted
the cover, and when a fellow has youth, and health and
not a care in the world, the search alone is a great game&ndash;&ndash;And
when he finds it!&ndash;&ndash;why, Billie, the dictionary hasn&rsquo;t
words enough to tell the story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I reckon not,&rdquo; said his listener in a small
voice, and when he looked around to speak to her again
she had disappeared, and across the patio Do&ntilde;a Luz
was coming towards him in no good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that poor little one weeps now when you
are returned, and not at other times?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Me, I have my troubles since that day they find the
Don Filipe shot dead,&ndash;&ndash;<i>Jesusita</i> give him rest! That
child is watching the Sonora trail and waiting since that
day, but no tears until you are come. I ask you how is
the way of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pike stared at her reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a bringer of news, likewise a faithful warden,&rdquo;
he observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m peaceably disposed, and not
wise to your lingo. Billie and me were talking as man
to man, free and confidential, and no argument. There
were no weeps that I noticed. What&rsquo;s the reason why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saints alone know, and not me!&rdquo; she returned
miserably. &ldquo;I think she is scared that it was the Se&ntilde;or
Rhodes who shooting Don Filipe, the vaqueros thinking
that! But she tells no one, and she is unhappy. Also
there is reason. That poor little one has the ranchos,
but have you hear how the debts are so high all the
herds can never pay? That is how they are saying
now about Granados and La Partida, and at the last our
se&ntilde;orita will have no herds, and no ranchos, and no
people but me. <i>Madre de Dios!</i> I try to think of her
in a little adobe by the river with only <i>frijoles</i> in the
dinner pot, and I no see it that way. And I not seeing
it other way. How you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s too new,&rdquo; confessed Pike. &ldquo;Who says
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Henderson. I hear him talk with Se&ntilde;or
Conrad, who has much sorrow because the Don Filipe
made bad contracts and losing the money little and
little, and then the counting comes, and it is big, very
big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the Se&ntilde;or Conrad has much sorrow, has he?&rdquo;
queried Pike, &ldquo;and Billie is getting her face to the wall
and crying? That&rsquo;s queer. Billie always unloaded her
troubles on me, and you say there was none of this
weeping till I came back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> She was making a long letter to Se&ntilde;or
Rhodes in Sonora,&ndash;&ndash;that I know. He sends no word,
so&ndash;&ndash;I leave it to you, se&ntilde;or, it takes faith and more faith
when a man is silent, and the word of a killing is against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Godfrey, woman! He never got a letter, he
knows nothing of a killing. How in hell&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Then the
captain checked himself as he saw the uselessness of
protesting to Do&ntilde;a Luz. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Billie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie was perched on a window seat in the <i>sala</i>, her
eyes were more than a trifle red, and she appeared deeply
engrossed in the pages of a week-old country paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see here that Don Jos&eacute; Perez of Hermosillo is to
marry Do&ntilde;a Dolores Terain, the daughter of the general,&rdquo;
she observed impersonally. &ldquo;He owns Rancho
Soledad, and promises the Sonora people he will drive
the rebel Rotil into the sea, and it was but yesterday Tia
Luz was telling me of his beautiful wife, Jocasta, who
was only a little mountain girl when he rode through
her village and saw her first. She is still alive, and it
looks to me as if all men are alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; agreed Pike amicably, &ldquo;some of us
more, some of us less. Do&ntilde;a Dolores probably spells
politics, but Do&ntilde;a Jocasta is a wildcat of the sierras, and
I can&rsquo;t figure out any harmonious days for a man who
picks two like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t deserve harmony; no man does who
isn&rsquo;t true&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; finished Billie rather lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, honey child,&rdquo; observed Pike, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll turn
man hater if you keep on working your imagination.
Luz tells me you are cranky against Kit, and that the
ranches are tied up in business knots tighter than I had
any notion of, so you had better unload the worst you
can think of on me; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. What difference
do the Perez favorites make to our young lives?
Neither Dolores nor Jocasta will help play the cards in
our fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherein Captain Pike was not of the prophets. The
wells of Sonora are not so many but that he who pitches
his tent near one has a view and greetings of all drifting
things of the desert, and the shadowed star of Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta of the south was leading her into the Soledad
wilderness forsaken of all white men but one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>COVERING THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Each minute of the long days, Rhodes worked steadily
and gaily, picking out the high grade ore from
the old Indian mine, and every possible night he and the
burro and Tula made a trip out to the foot of the range,
where they buried their treasure against the happy day
when they could go out of the silent desert content for
the time with what gold they could carry in secret to the
border.</p>
<p>For two days he had watched the Soledad ranch
house rather closely through the field glass, for there
was more activity there than before; men in groups rode
in who were not herding. He wondered if it meant a
military occupation, in which case he would need to be
doubly cautious when emerging from the hidden trail.</p>
<p>The girl worked as he worked. Twice he had made
new sandals for her, and also for himself in order to
save his boots so that they might at least be wearable
when he got among people. All plans had been thought
out and discussed until no words would be needed between
them when they separated. She was to appear alone at
Palomitas with a tale of escape from the slavers, and he
was carefully crushing and mashing enough color to
partly fill a buckskin bag to show as the usual fruits of a
prospect trip from which he was returning to Mesa
Blanca after exhausting grub stake and shoe leather.</p>
<p>The things of the world had stood still for him during
that hidden time of feverish work. He scarcely dared
try to estimate the value of the ore he had dug as honey
from a hollow tree, but it was rich&ndash;&ndash;rich! There were
nuggets of pure gold, assorted as to their various sizes,
while he milled and ground the quartz roughly, and
cradled it in the water of the brook.</p>
<p>By the innocent aid of Baby Bunting, two wild burros
of the sierra had been enticed within reach for slaughter,
and, aside from the food values, they furnished green
hide which under Kit&rsquo;s direction, Tula deftly made into
bags for carrying the gold.</p>
<p>All activities during the day were carefully confined
within a certain radius, low enough in the little ca&ntilde;on
to run no risk in case any inquisitive resident of Soledad
should study the ranges with a field glass, though Kit had
not seen one aside from his own since he entered Sonora.
And he used his own very carefully every morning and
evening on the wide valley of Soledad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something doing down there, sister,&rdquo; he decided,
as they were preparing for the last trail out. &ldquo;Riders
who look like cavalry, mules, and some wagons&ndash;&ndash;mighty
queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula came over and stood beside him expectantly. He
had learned that a look through the magic glasses was
the most coveted gift the camp could grant to her, and
it had become part of the regular routine that she stood
waiting her turn for the wide look, the &ldquo;enchant look,&rdquo;
as she had called it that first morning. It had become
a game to try to see more than he, and this time she mentioned
as he had, the wagons, and mules, and riders. And
then she looked long and uttered a brief Indian word
of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat me again, have you?&rdquo; queried Kit good
humoredly. &ldquo;What do you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman is there, in that wagon,&ndash;&ndash;sick maybe. Also
one man is a padre; see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit took the glasses and saw she was right. A man
who looked like a priest was helping a woman from a
wagon, she stumbled forward and then was half carried
by two men towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an Indian woman?&rdquo; asked Kit, and again her
unchildlike mind worked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A padre does not bow his head to help Indian woman.
Caballeros do not lift them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I reckon Don Jos&eacute; Perez is home on a visit, and
brought his family. A queer time! Other ranch folks are
getting their women north over the border for safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Jos&eacute; not bring woman to Soledad&ndash;&ndash;ever. He
take them away. His men take them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first reference she had made to the slavers
since they had entered the ca&ntilde;on, though she knew that
each pile of nuggets was part of the redemption money
for those exiles of whom she did not speak.</p>
<p>But she worked tirelessly until Kit would stop her, or
suggest some restful task to vary the steady grind of
carrying, pounding, or washing the quartz. He had
ordered her to make two belts, that each of them might
carry some of the gold hidden under their garments.
She had a nugget tied in a corner of her <i>manta</i>, and other
small ones fastened in her girdle, while in the belt next
her body she carried all he deemed safe to weight her
with, probably five pounds. At any hint of danger she
would hide the belt and walk free.</p>
<p>His own belt would carry ten pounds without undue
bulkiness. And over three hundred pounds of high grade
gold was already safely hidden near the great rock with
the symbols of sun and rain marking its weathered
surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fair hundred thousand, and the vein only
scratched!&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;I was sore over losing the
job on Billie&rsquo;s ranch,&ndash;&ndash;but gee! this looks as if I was
knocked out in the cold world to reach my good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a blue dusk of evening they left the camp behind
and started over the trail, after Tula had carefully left
fragments of food on the tomb of Miguel, placed there for
the ghosts who are drawn to a comrade.</p>
<p>Kit asked no questions concerning any of her tribal
customs, since to do so would emphasize the fact that
they were peculiar and strange to him, and the Indian
mind, wistfully alert, would sense that strangeness and
lose its unconsciousness in the presence of an alien. So,
when she went, after meals, to offer dregs of the soup
kettle or bones of the burro, she often found a bunch
of desert blossoms wilting there in the heat, and these
tributes left by Kit went far to strengthen her confidence.
It was as if Miguel was a live partner in their
activities, never forgotten by either. So they left him on
guard, and turned their faces toward the outer world
of people.</p>
<p>Knowing more than he dare tell the girl his mind was
considerably occupied with that woman at Soledad, for
military control changed over night in many a province
of Mexico in revolutionary days, and the time at the
hidden mine might have served for many changes.</p>
<p>Starlight and good luck was on the trail for them, and
at earliest streak of dawn they buried their treasure, divided
their dried burro meat, and with every precaution
to hide the trail where they emerged from the gray sierra,
they struck the road to Mesa Blanca.</p>
<p>Until full day came Tula rode the burro, and slipped
off at a ravine where she could walk hidden, on the way
to Palomitas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buntin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Kit, watching her go, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have
pardners and pardners in our time, but we&rsquo;ll never find
one more of a thoroughbred than that raggedy Indian
witch-child of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the slanting cattle trail up over the mesa,
avoiding the wagon road below, and at the far edge of
it halted to look down over the wide spreading leagues of
the Mesa Blanca ranch.</p>
<p>It looked very sleepy, drowsing in the silence of the
noon sun. An old Indian limped slowly from the corral
over to the ranch house, and a child tumbled in the dust
with a puppy, but there was no other sign of ranch
activity. As he descended the mesa and drew nearer
the corrals they had a deserted look, not merely empty
but deserted.</p>
<p>The puppy barked him a welcome, but the child gave
one frightened look at Kit, and with a howl of fear, raced
to the shelter of the portal where he disappeared in the
shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a hunch, Babe, that we needed smoothing down
with a currycomb before we made social calls,&rdquo; confessed
Kit to the burro, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t reckon on scaring the
natives in any such fashion as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was conscious of peering eyes at a barred window,
and then the old Indian appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Isidro!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; mumbled the old man, and
then he stared at the burro, and at the bearded and rather
desert-worn stranger, and uttered a cry of glad recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ai-ji! It is El Pajarito coming again to Mesa
Blanca, but coming with dust in your mouth and no song!
Enter, se&ntilde;or, and take your rest in your own house. None
are left to do you honor but me,&ndash;&ndash;all gone like that!&rdquo;
and his skinny black hands made a gesture as if wafting
the personnel of Mesa Blanca on its way. &ldquo;The General
Rotil has need the cattle, and makes a divide with
Se&ntilde;or Whitely and all go,&ndash;&ndash;all the herds,&rdquo; and he pointed
east.</p>
<p>Kit bathed his face in the cool water brought out by
Valencia, Isidro&rsquo;s wife, then unloaded the burro of the
outfit, and stretched himself in the shade while the women
busied themselves preparing food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So General Rotil makes a divide of the cattle,&ndash;&ndash;of
Whitely&rsquo;s cattle? How is that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>And the old Indian proceeded to tell him that it was
true. The Deliverer must feed his army. He needed
half, and promised Whitely to furnish a guard for the
rest of the herd and help Whitely save them by driving
them to Imuris, where the railroad is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said enemy troops would come from the south and
take them all in one week or one month. He, Rotil,
would pay a price. Thus it was, and Se&ntilde;or Whitely, and
enough vaqueros, rode with the herds, and General Rotil
took the rest of the ranchmen to be his soldiers. Of
course it might be Se&ntilde;or Whitely would some day return,
who knows? And he left a letter for the se&ntilde;or of the
songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter corroborated Isidro&rsquo;s statements&ndash;&ndash;it was
the only way to save any of the stock. Whitely thought
there was a hundred or two still ranging in the far corners,
but time was short, and he was saving what he
could. The men were joining the revolutionists and he
would be left without help anyway. If Rhodes came
back he was to use the place as his own. If he could
round up any more horses or cattle on the range and
get them to safety Isidro would find some Indians to
help him, and Whitely would divide the profits with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&ndash;&ndash;divides first with the Deliverer, and next
with me! Can&rsquo;t see where that hombre gets off when it
comes to staking his own family to a living. But it&rsquo;s a
bargain, and this is my headquarters until I can get out.
How long has Whitely and his new friends been gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four days, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen any stragglers of cattle left behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isidro&rsquo;s grandson, Clodomiro, had found both horses
and cattle and herded them into far ca&ntilde;ons; a man might
ride in a circle for five miles around the ranch house
and see never a fresh track. Clodomiro was a good boy,
and of much craft.</p>
<p>Dinner was announced for the se&ntilde;or, and the women
showed him welcome by placing before him the most
beautiful repast they could arrange quickly, <i>chile con
carne</i>, <i>frijoles</i>, <i>tortillas</i>, and a decanter of Sonora wine&ndash;&ndash;a
feast for a king!</p>
<p>After he had eaten, tobacco was brought him from
some little hidden store, and Isidro gave him the details of
the slave raid of Palomitas, and Sonora affairs in general.
Kit was careful to state that he has been prospecting in
the mountains and out of touch with ranch people, and
it must be understood that all Isidro could tell would be
news to a miner from the desert mountains. And he
asked if General Rotil also collected stock from the ranch
of Soledad.</p>
<p>Whereupon Isidro told him many things, and among
them the wonder that Soledad had been left alone&ndash;&ndash;the
saints only knew why! And Juan Gonsalvo, the foreman
at Soledad, had helped with the slave raid, and was known
in Palomitas where they took girls and women and men
as well, even men not young! Miguel, the major-domo,
was taken with his wife and two daughters, the other
men were young. The curse of God seemed striking
Sonora. A new foreman was now at Soledad, Marto
Cavayso, a hard man and,&ndash;&ndash;it was said, a soldier, but
he evidently got tired of fighting and was taking his
rest by managing the horse herds of Soledad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like rest to me,&rdquo; observed Kit. &ldquo;The
Soledad trail looks pretty well kicked into holes, with
wagons, mules, and horsemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isidro volunteered his opinion that work of the devil
was going forward over there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan Gonsalvo and El Aleman were stealing women
in Sonora, and driving them the south trail for a price,&rdquo;
he stated. &ldquo;But what think you would be the price for
a woman of emerald eyes and white skin carried up from
the south under chains, and a lock to the chain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you are dreaming the lock and chain part of
it, Isidro,&rdquo; returned Kit. &ldquo;Only murderers travel like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>, it is so. There at Soledad it is heard. A killing
was done in the south and Soledad is her prison. But
she is beautiful, and the men are casting lots as to whose
she shall be when the guard is gone south again to Don
Jos&eacute; Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! they are Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s men, are they? Then the
prisoner is guarded by his orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? They tell that she is a lost soul, and
fought for a knife to kill herself, and the padre makes
prayers and says hell will be hers if she does. Elena,
who is cook, heard him say that word, and Elena was
once wife to my brother, and she is telling that to Clodomiro
who makes an errand to take her deer meat, and hear
of the strangers. He saw the woman, her bracelets are
gold, and her eyes are green. The padre calls her Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta. I go now and give drink to that burro and
make him happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jocasta, eh? Do&ntilde;a Jocasta!&rdquo; repeated Kit in wondering
meditation. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem possible&ndash;&ndash;but reckon
it is, and there are no real surprises in Sonora. Anything
could, and does happen here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembered Pike telling the story of Jocasta one
morning by their camp fire in the desert. She was called
by courtesy Se&ntilde;ora Perez. He had not heard her father&rsquo;s
name, but he was a Spanish priest and her mother an
Indian half-breed girl&ndash;&ndash;some little village in the sierras.
There were two daughters, and the younger was blond as
a child of Old Spain, Jocasta was the elder and raven
dark of hair, a skin of deep cream, and jewel-green eyes.
Kit had heard three men, including Isidro, speak of Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta, and each had mentioned the wonderful green
eyes&ndash;&ndash;no one ever seemed to forget them!</p>
<p>Their magnetism had caught the attention of Don Jos&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;a
distinguished and illustrious person in the eyes of the
barefoot mountaineers. No one knew what Jocasta
thought of the exalted padrone of the wide lands, whose
very spurs were of gold, but she knew there was scarce
wealth enough in all the village to keep a candle burning
on the Virgin&rsquo;s shrine, and her feet had never known a
shoe. The padre died suddenly just as Don Jos&eacute; was
making a bargain with him for the girl, so he swept
Jocasta to his saddle with no bargain whatever except
that she might send back for Lucita, her little sister, and
other men envied Perez his good luck when they looked
at Jocasta. For three years she had been mistress of his
house in Hermosillo, but never had he taken her into
the wilderness of Soledad,&ndash;&ndash;it was a crude casket for so
rich a treasure.</p>
<p>Kit steeped in the luxury of a square meal, fell asleep,
thinking of the green-eyed Do&ntilde;a Jocasta whom no man
forgot. He would not connect a brilliant bird of the
mountain with that drooping figure he and Tula had seen
stumbling towards the portal of Soledad. And the statement
of Isidro that there had been a killing, and Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta was a lost soul, was most puzzling of all. In a
queer confused dream the killing was done by Tula, and
Billie wore the belt of gold, and had green eyes. And
he wakened himself with the apparently hopeless effort
of convincing Billie he had never forgotten her despite
the feminine witcheries of Sonora.</p>
<p>The shadows were growing long, and some Indian boys
were jogging across the far flats. He reached for his
field glass and saw that one of them had a deer across
his saddle. Isidro explained that the boys were planting
corn in a far field, and often brought a deer when they
came in for more seed or provisions. They had a hut
and <i>ramada</i> at the edge of the planted land six miles
away. They were good boys, Benito and Mariano Bravo,
and seldom both left the fields at the same time. He
called to Valencia that there would be deer for supper,
then watched the two riders as they approached, and
smiled as they perceptibly slowed up their broncos at
sight of the bearded stranger on the rawhide cot against
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you!&rdquo; he pointed out to Kit. &ldquo;These are the
days of changes. Each day we looking for another
enemy, maybe that army of the south, and the boys they
think that way too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys, on being hailed, came to the house with their
offering, and bunkered down in the shadow with a certain
shy stolidity, until Kit spoke, when they at once
beamed recognition, and made jokes of his beard as a
blanket.</p>
<p>But they had news to tell, great news, for a child of
Miguel had broken away from the slavers and had hidden
in the mountains, and at last had found her way back to
Palomitas. She was very tired and very poor in raiment,
and the people were weeping over her. Miguel, her
father, was dead from a wound, and was under the
ground, and of the others who went on she could tell
nothing, only that Conrad, the German friend of Don
Jos&eacute;, was the man who covered his face and helped take
the women. Her sister Anita had recognized him, calling
out his name, and he had struck her with a quirt.</p>
<p>The women left their work to listen to this, and to
add the memories of some of their friends who had
hidden and luckily escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That white man should be crucified and left for the
vultures,&rdquo; said the boy Benito.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the soft voice of Valencia, &ldquo;God was sacrificed,
but this man is a white Judas; the death of God is
too good for that man. It has been talked about. He
will be found some place,&ndash;&ndash;and the Judas death will be
his. The women are making prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon be Easter,&rdquo; said Isidro.</p>
<p>Kit did not know what was meant by a &ldquo;Judas&rdquo; death,
though he did know many of the church legends had been
turned by the Indians into strange and lurid caricatures.
He thought it would be interesting to see how they could
enlarge on the drama of Judas, but he made no comment,
as a direct question would turn the Indians thoughtful,
and silence them.</p>
<p>They all appeared alert for the return of Rotil. No
one believed he had retired utterly from the region without
demanding tribute from Soledad. It was generally
suspected that Perez received and held munitions for use
against the revolutionists though no one knew where they
were hidden. There were Indian tales of underground
tunnels of Soledad Mission for retreat in the old days in
case of hostile attacks, and the Soledad ranch house was
built over part of that foundation. No one at Soledad
knew the entrance except Perez himself, though it was
surmised that Juan Gonsalvo had known, and had been
the one to store the mule loads and wagon loads of
freight shipped over the border before Miguel Herrara
was caught at the work from the American side. Perez
was a careful man, and not more than one man was
trusted at one time. That man seemed marked by the
angels for accident, for something had always ended him,
and it was no good fortune to be a favorite of Don Jos&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta was learning that!</p>
<p>Thus the gossip and surmise went on around Rhodes
for his brief hour of rest and readjustment. He encouraged
the expression of opinion from every source,
for he had the job ahead of him to get three hundred
pounds of gold across the border and through a region
where every burro was liable to examination by some of
the warring factions. It behooved him to consider every
tendency of the genus homo with which he came in contact.
Also the bonds between them,&ndash;&ndash;especially the
bonds, since the various groups were much of a sameness,
and only &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; according to their affiliations.
Simple Benito and his brother, and soft-voiced motherly
Valencia who could conceive a worse death for the German
Judas than crucifixion, were typical of the primitive
people of desert and sierra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many head of stock think you still ranges Mesa
Blanca?&rdquo; he asked Isidro, who confessed that he no
longer rode abroad or kept tally, but Clodomiro would
know, and would be in to supper. Benito and Mariano
told of one stallion and a dozen mares beyond the hills,
and a spring near their fields had been muddied the day
before by a bunch of cows and calves, they thought perhaps
twenty, and they had seen three mules with the
Mesa Blanca brand when they were getting wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three mules, eh? Well, I may need those mules
and the favor will be to me if you keep them in sight,&rdquo; he
said addressing the boys. &ldquo;I am to round up what I can
and remove them after Se&ntilde;or Whitely, together with
other belongings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; asked Isidro.</p>
<p>Rhodes took the letter from his pocket, and perused
it as if to refresh his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Spanish chest is to go if possible, and other
things of Mrs. Whitely&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will speak of these
to your wife if the plan can carry, but there is chance
of troops from the south and&ndash;&ndash;who knows?&ndash;&ndash;we may be
caught between the two armies and ground as meal on a
<i>metate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thus avoided all detail as to the loads the pack
animals were to carry, and the written word was a safe
mystery to the Indian. He was making no definite plans,
but was learning all possibilities with a mind prepared
to take advantage of the most promising.</p>
<p>Thus the late afternoon wore on in apparent restful
idleness after the hard trail. The boys secured their little
allowance of beans and salt, and corn for planting, but
lingered after the good supper of Valencia, a holiday
feast compared with their own sketchy culinary performance
in the <i>jacal</i> of the far fields. They scanned the
trail towards Palomitas, and then the way down the far
western valley, evidently loath to leave until their friend
Clodomiro should arrive, and Isidro expected him before
sunset.</p>
<p>But he came later from towards Soledad, a tall lad with
fluttering ribbands of pink and green from his banda and
his elbows, and a girdle of yellow fluttering fringed ends
to the breeze,&ndash;&ndash;all the frank insignia of a youth in the
market for marriage. He suggested a gay graceful bird
as he rode rapidly in the long lope of the range. His
boy friends of the planted fields went out to meet him
at the corral, and look after his horse while he went in
to supper. He halted to greet them, and then walked
soberly across the plaza where pepper trees and great
white alisos trailed dusk shadows in the early starlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>reata</i> held you?&rdquo; asked Isidro. &ldquo;Has Soledad
grown a place for comradeship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said the lad passing into the dining room
where two candles gave him light in the old adobe room,
&ldquo;it is comradeship we do not need, but it is coming to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated himself on the wooden bench and his grandmother
helped him from a smoking plate of venison. He
looked tired and troubled, and he had not even taken note
that a stranger was beside Isidro in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nettle stings you, boy?&rdquo; asked his grandfather
sarcastically, and at that he looked up and rose to his
feet at sight of Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, se&ntilde;or, I stumbled past like a bat blind
in the light,&rdquo; he muttered, and as he met Kit&rsquo;s eyes and
recognized him his face lit up and his white teeth gleamed
in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saints are in it that you are here again, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, &ldquo;and you came on this day when most
needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat and then tell your meaning,&rdquo; said Isidro, but
Clodomiro glanced toward the kitchen, and then listened
for the other boys. They were laughing down at the
corral. Clodomiro&rsquo;s horse had thrown one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission, grandfather, talk first,&rdquo; he
said and the two men moved to the bench opposite, leaning
over towards him as his voice was lowered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today Marto Cavayso sent for me, he is foreman
over there, and strange things are going forward. He
has heard that General Rotil stripped Mesa Blanca and
that all white people are gone from it. He wants this
house and will pay us well to open the door. It is for the
woman. They have played a game for her, and he has
won, but she is a wild woman when he goes near her,
and his plan is to steal her out at night and hide her from
the others. So he wants this house. He offered me a
good gun. He offers us the protection of Don Jos&eacute;
Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;that is not credible,&rdquo; protested Kit.
&ldquo;He could not count on protection from Perez if he stole
the woman whom many call Se&ntilde;ora Perez, for that is
what they did call Do&ntilde;a Jocasta in Hermosillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; assented Clodomiro stolidly, &ldquo;but now he
is to be the <i>esposo</i> of a Do&ntilde;a Dolores who is the child
of General Terain, so Marto says. Well, this Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta has done some killing, and Don Jos&eacute; does not give
her to prison. He sends her to the desert that she brings
him no disgrace; and if another man takes her or sinks
her in the quicksands then that man will be helping Don
Jos&eacute;. That is how it is. Marto says the woman has bewitched
him, and he is crazy about her. Some of the
other men, will take her, if not him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit exchanged a long look with the old Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house is yours, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Isidro. &ldquo;By the
word of Se&ntilde;or Whitely, you are manager of Mesa
Blanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; replied Kit, and sat with his elbows
on the table and his hands over his eyes, thinking&ndash;&ndash;thinking
of the task he had set himself in Sonora, and
the new turn of the wheel of fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the lady is a prisoner?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; returned Clodomiro promptly. &ldquo;She broke
loose coming through a little pueblo and ran to the church.
She found the priest and told him things, so they also
take that priest! If they let him go he will talk, and Don
Jos&eacute; wanting no talk now of this woman. That priest is
well cared for, but not let go away. After awhile, maybe
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is bright, and her father was a priest,&rdquo; mused Kit.
&ldquo;So there is three chances out of four that she can read
and write,&ndash;&ndash;a little anyway. Could you get a letter to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elena could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit got up, took one of the candles from the table and
walked through the rooms surrounding the patio. Some
of them had wooden bars in the windows, but others had
iron grating, and he examined these carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two rooms fit for perfectly good jails,&rdquo; he
decided, &ldquo;so I vote we give this bewitched Don Marto
the open door. How many guns can we muster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised to give me one, and ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you get it! Get two if you can, but at least
get plenty of ammunition. Isidro, will your wife be brave
and willing to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Indian nodded his head vigorously and smiled.
Evidently only a stranger would ask if his Valencia
could be brave!</p>
<p>The two brothers came in, and conversation was more
guarded until Clodomiro had finished his supper, and gone
a little ways home with them to repay them the long wait
for comradeship.</p>
<p>When he came back Kit had his plans fairly settled, and
had a brief note written to Se&ntilde;ora Jocasta Perez, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Honored Se&ntilde;ora</span>:</p>
<p>One chance of safety is yours. Let yourself be persuaded
to leave Soledad with Marto. You will be rescued from him
by</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>An American.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that will do the trick,&rdquo; decided Kit. &ldquo;I feel
like a blooming Robin Hood without the merry men,&ndash;&ndash;but
the Indians will play safe, even if they are not merry.
When can you get this to Elena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time of breakfast,&rdquo; said Clodomiro promptly. &ldquo;I
go tonight, and tomorrow night he steals that woman.
Maybe Elena helps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take Elena a present from me to encourage that
help,&rdquo; suggested Kit, and he poured a little of the gold
from his belt on the paper. &ldquo;Also there is the same for
you when the lady comes safe. It is best that you make
willing offer of your service in all ways so that he calls
on none of his own men for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; assented Clodomiro, &ldquo;and that
will march well with his desires, for to keep the others
from knowing is the principal thing. She has beauty
like a lily in the shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tells you that?&rdquo; asked Kit quizzically, but the
boy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own eyes looked on her. She is truly of the
beauty of the holy pictures of the saints in the chapel,
but Marto says she is a witch, and has him enchanted;&ndash;&ndash;also
that evil is very strong in her. I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cross your fingers and tackle the job,&rdquo; suggested
Kit. &ldquo;Get what sleep you can, for you may not
get much tomorrow night. It is the work of a brave man
you are going to do, and your pay will be a man&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the Indian boy glowed with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;or. I will do this thing or I will
not see Mesa Blanca again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit looked after Clodomiro and rolled another cigarette
before turning in to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all&rsquo;s said and done, I may be the chief goat of
this dame adventure,&rdquo; he told himself in derision. &ldquo;Maybe
my own fingers need crossing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN OF EMERALD EYES</h3>
</div>
<p>At the first break of dawn, Rhodes was up, and
without waiting for breakfast walked over to the
rancherias of Palomitas to see Tula.</p>
<p>She was with some little girls and old women carrying
water from the well as stolidly as though adventure had
never stalked across her path. A whole garment had been
given her instead of the tatter of rags in which she had
returned to the little Indian pueblo. She replied briefly
to his queries regarding her welfare, and when he asked
where she was living, she accompanied him to an old
adobe where there were two other motherless children&ndash;&ndash;victims
of the raiders.</p>
<p>An old, half-blind woman stirred meal into a kettle of
porridge, and to her Kit addressed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blessing will be on your house, but you have too
many to feed here,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;and the child of Miguel
should go to the ranch house of Mesa Blanca. The wife
of Isidro is a good woman and will give her care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, she is a good woman,&rdquo; agreed the old
Indian. &ldquo;Also it may be a safe house for a maiden,
who knows? Here it is not safe; other raiders may
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. Send her after she has eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sought out one of the older men to learn who
could be counted on to round up the stray cattle of the
ranges. After that he went at once back to the ranch
house, and did not even speak to Tula again. There
was nothing to indicate that she was the principal object
of his visit, or that she had acquired a guardian who was
taking his job seriously.</p>
<p>Later in the day she was brought to Mesa Blanca by
an elderly Indian woman of her mother&rsquo;s clan, and settled
in the quiet Indian manner in the new dwelling place.
Valencia was full of pity for the girl of few years who
had yet known the hard trail, and had mourned alone for
her dead.</p>
<p>There was a sort of suppressed bustle about <i>la casa de
Mesa Blanca</i> that day, dainties of cookery prepared with
difficulty from the diminished stores, and the rooms of
the iron bars sprinkled and swept, and pillows of wondrous
drawnwork decorated the more pretentious bed.
To Tula it was more of magnificence than she had ever
seen in her brief life, and the many rooms in one dwelling
was a wonder. She would stand staring across the patio
and into the various doorways through which she hesitated
to pass. She for whom the wide silences of the
desert held few terrors, hesitated to linger alone in the
shadows of the circling walls. Kit noted that when each
little task was finished for Valencia, she would go outside
in the sunlight where she had the familiar ranges
and far blue mountains in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it makes much trouble only to live in a house,&rdquo;
she said pointing to the needlework on a table cover.
&ldquo;The bowls of food will make that dirty in one eating,
and then what? Women in fine houses are only as mares
in time of thrashing the grain&ndash;&ndash;no end and no beginning
to the work,&ndash;&ndash;they only tread their circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, sister,&rdquo; agreed Kit, &ldquo;they do make
a lot of whirligig work for themselves, all the same as
your grandmothers painting pottery that smash like eggshells.
But life here isn&rsquo;t all play at that, and there may
be something doing before sleep time tonight. I went
after you so I would have a comrade I knew would stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only gazed at him without question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember, Tula, the woman led by the padre at
Soledad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that woman is captive to the same men who
took your people,&rdquo; he said slowly watching her, &ldquo;and it
may be we can save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it also be that we can catch the man?&rdquo; she
asked, and her eyes half closed, peered up at him in
curious intensity. &ldquo;Can that be, O friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day it must surely be, Tula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day it must be,&ndash;&ndash;one day, and prayers are making
all the times for that day,&rdquo; she insisted stolidly. &ldquo;The
old women are talking, and for that day they want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day, Tula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Judas day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes felt a curious creepy sensation of being
near an unseen danger, some sleeping serpent basking in
the sun, harmless until aroused for attack. He thought
of the gentle domestic Valencia, and now this child, both
centered on one thought&ndash;&ndash;to sacrifice a traitor on the
day of Judas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girls should make helpful prayers,&rdquo; he ventured
rather lamely, &ldquo;not vengeance prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the one to make cry of a woman, when my
father went under the earth,&rdquo; she said. It was her only
expression of the fact that she had borne a woman&rsquo;s
share of all their joint toil in the desert,&ndash;&ndash;and he caught
her by the shoulder, as she turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kid Cleopatra, it isn&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s work you&rsquo;ve
done at all. It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s job you&rsquo;ve held down and held
level,&rdquo; he declared heartily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I am counting
on you now. I need eyes to watch when I have to be in
other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watch,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;I watch for you, but maybe
I make my own prayers also;&ndash;&ndash;all the time prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make one for a straight trail to the border, and all
sentries asleep!&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;We have a pile of yellow
rock to get across, to say nothing of our latest puzzling
prospect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the day wore on the latest &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; presented
many complications to the imagination, and he tramped
the corridors of Mesa Blanca wondering why he had seen
but one side of the question the night before, for in the
broad light of day there seemed a dozen, and all leading
to trouble! That emerald-eyed daughter of a renegade
priest had proven a host in herself when it came to breeding
trouble. She certainly had been unlucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be worse,&rdquo; he confided to Bunting out
in the corral. &ldquo;Cap Pike might have tagged along to discourse
on the general tomfoolery of a partner who picks
up a damsel in distress at every fork of the trail. Not
that he&rsquo;d be far wrong at that, Baby. If any hombre
wanted to catch me in a bear trap he&rsquo;d only need to bait
it with a skirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baby Bunting nodded sagaciously, and nuzzled after
Kit who was cleaning up the best looking saddle horse
brought in from the Indian herd. It was a scraggy sorrel
with twitchy ears and wicked eyes, but it looked tough
as a mountain buck. Kit knew he should need two like
that for the northern trail, and had hopes that the bewitched
Marto Cavayso, whoever he was, would furnish
another.</p>
<p>He went steadily about his preparations for the border
trail, just as if the addition of an enchantress with green-jewel
eyes was an every day bit of good fortune expected
in every outfit, but as the desert ranges flamed rose and
mauve in the lowering sun there was a restless expectancy
at the ranch house, bolts and locks and firearms were
given final inspection. Even at the best it was a scantily
manned fort for defense in case Mario&rsquo;s companions at
dice should question his winning and endeavor to capture
the stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go part way on the Soledad trail and wait
what happens,&rdquo; he told Isidro. &ldquo;I will remain at a distance
unless Clodomiro needs me. There is no telling
what tricks this Cavayso may have up his sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking that same thought,&rdquo; said the old
Indian. &ldquo;The men of Perez are not trusted long, even
by Perez. When it is a woman, they are not trusted even
in sight! Go with God on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ugly young sorrel ran tirelessly the first half of the
way, just enough to prove his wind. Then they entered
a ca&ntilde;on where scrub cottonwoods and greasebush gathered
moisture enough for scant growth among the
boulders worn out of the cliffs by erosion. It was the
safest place to wait, as it was also the most likely place
for treachery if any was intended to Clodomiro. At
either end of the pass lay open range and brown desert,
with only far patches of oasis where a well was found, or
a sunken river marked a green pasture in some valley.</p>
<p>When he wrote the note he had not thought of danger
to Clodomiro, regarding him only as a fearless messenger,
but if the boy should prove an incumbrance to Cavayso
after they were free of Soledad, that might prove another
matter, and as old Isidro had stated, no one trusted a
Perez man when a woman was in question!</p>
<p>He dismounted to listen and seek safe shadow, for the
dusk had come, and desert stars swung like brilliant lamps
in the night sky, and the white rocks served as clear background
for any moving body.</p>
<p>The plan was, if possible, to get the woman out with
Clodomiro while the men were at supper. The <i>manta</i> of
Elena could cover her, and if she could walk with a water
jar to the far well as any Indian woman would walk, and
a horse hid in the willows there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>It had been well thought out, and if nothing had interfered
they should have reached the ca&ntilde;on an hour earlier.
If Clodomiro had failed it might be a serious matter, and
Kit Rhodes had some anxious moments for the stolen
woman while dusk descended on the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>He listened for the beat of horse hoofs, but what he
heard first was a shot, and a woman&rsquo;s scream, and then
the walls of the ca&ntilde;on echoed the tumult of horses racing
towards him in flight.</p>
<p>He recognized Clodomiro by the bare head and banda,
and a woman bent low beside him, her <i>manta</i> flapping
like the wings of a great bird as her horse leaped forward
beside the Indian boy.</p>
<p>Back of them galloped a man who slowed up and shot
backward at the foremost of a pursuing band.</p>
<p>He missed, and the fire was returned, evidently with
some effect, for the first marksman grunted and cursed,
and Kit heard the clatter of his gun as it fell from his
hand. He leaned forward and spurred his horse to outrun
the pursuers. He was evidently Marto.</p>
<p>Kit had a mental vision of fighting Marto alone for the
woman at Mesa Blanca, or fighting with the entire band
and decided to halt the leader of the pursuers and gain
that much time at least for the woman and Clodomiro.</p>
<p>He had mounted at the first sound of the runaways,
and crouching low in the saddle, hid back of the thick
green of a dwarfed mesquite, and as the leader came into
range against the white rock well he aimed low and
touched the trigger.</p>
<p>The horse leaped up and the rider slid off as the animal
sunk to the ground. Kit guided his mount carefully along
shadowed places into the road expecting each instant a
shot from the man on the ground.</p>
<p>But it did not come, and he gained the trail before the
other pursuers rounded the bend of the ca&ntilde;on. The
sound of their hoofs would deafen them to his, and once
on the trail he gave the sorrel the rein, and the wild thing
went down the gully like an arrow from a bow.</p>
<p>He was more than a little puzzled at the silence back
of him. The going down of the one man and horse had
evidently checked all pursuit. Relieved though he was at
the fact, he realized it was not a natural condition of
affairs, and called for explanation.</p>
<p>The other three riders were a half mile ahead and he
had no idea of joining them on the trail. It occurred to
him there was a possible chance of taking a short cut over
the point of the mesa and beating them to the home ranch.
There was an even chance that the rougher trail would
offer difficulties in the dark, but that was up to the sorrel
and was worth the trial.</p>
<p>The bronco took the mesa walls like a cat, climbed and
staggered up, slid and tumbled down and crossed the
level intervening space to the corral as the first sound of
the others came beating across the sands.</p>
<p>A dark little figure arose by the corral bars and reached
for the horse as he slipped from the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly, Tulita!&rdquo; he said, stripping saddle and bridle
from its back, &ldquo;one instant only to make ourselves as still
as shadows under the walls of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fast as he ran, she kept pace with him to the corridor
where Isidro waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; he said briefly to the old man. &ldquo;Clodomiro
comes safe with the se&ntilde;ora, and the man who would
steal her was shot and lost his gun. All has gone very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to God!&rdquo; said the old Indian. &ldquo;The stealing
of women has ever been a danger near, but luck
comes well to you, se&ntilde;or, and it is good to be under
the protection of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door and show a light of welcome,&rdquo; said
Kit. &ldquo;Call your wife and let all be as planned by us.
I will be in the shadows, and a good gun for safety of
the woman if needed, but all will work well, as you will
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three riders came up to the portal before dismounting,
and Valencia went forward, while Isidro held
high a blazing torch, and Clodomiro dismounted quickly,
and offered help to the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandmother has all for your comfort, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;will it please you to descend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man swung from the saddle, awkwardly nursing
his right arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes this is a safe place, Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;It is all well arranged. With your permission I may
assist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered his left hand, but she looked from him to
Valencia, and then to Clodomiro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are young to be a stealer of women;&ndash;&ndash;the saints
send you a whiter road!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And you may help
me, for my shoulder has a hurt from that first shot of
the comrade of this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; stated her captor, &ldquo;the evil shot came
from no comrade of mine. They did not follow us, those
bandits&ndash;&ndash;accursed be their names! They were hid in
the ca&ntilde;oncita and jumped our trail. But have no fear,
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, they are left behind, and it will be my
pleasure to nurse the wounds they have made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be occupied with your own,&rdquo; she suggested pointing
to his hand from which blood still dripped, &ldquo;and you,
mother, can show me the new prison. It can be no worse
than the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, much better, little dove,&rdquo; said Marto, who
followed after the two women, and glanced over their
shoulders into the guest chamber of the iron bars, &ldquo;it is a
bird cage of the finest, and a nest for harmonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to Valencia he turned with authority, &ldquo;When
you have made the se&ntilde;orita comfortable, bring the key of
the door to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Valencia bending low, and even as
the prisoner entered the room, she changed the key to the
outside of the door. Marto nodded his approval and
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this shirt off, and a basin of water and a
bandage,&rdquo; he ordered Isidro. &ldquo;It is not much, and it still
bleeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, it does, se&ntilde;or, and the room ordered for you
has already the water and a clean shirt on the pillow.
Clodomiro, go you for a bandage, and fetch wine to
take dust out of the throat! This way, se&ntilde;or,&ndash;&ndash;and may
you be at home in your own house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unsuspecting, the amorous Marto followed the old man
into the room prepared. He grunted contemptuous satisfaction
at evidences of comfort extending to lace curtains
hanging white and full over the one window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the time for a shirt of such cleanness,&rdquo; he observed,
with a grin. &ldquo;<i>Jesusita!</i> but the sleeve sticks to me!
Cut it off, and be quick to make me over into a bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man did as he was bidden, and when Clodomiro
brought in a woven tray covered with a napkin from
which a bottle of wine was discernible, Marto grinned
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a soft nest you found for me, boy,&rdquo; he said
appreciatively, &ldquo;and when I am capitan I will make you
lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you, se&ntilde;or, and hasten the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodomiro assisted his grandfather, and stood aside at
the door respectfully as the old man passed out with his
primitive supply of salves and antiseptics, and only when
all need of caution was ended the boy smiled at the
would-be Lothario, and the smile held a subtle mockery
as he murmured, &ldquo;The saints send you a good night&rsquo;s
sleep, se&ntilde;or, and a waking to health&ndash;&ndash;and clearer sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell and its blazes to you! why do you grin?&rdquo; demanded
the other setting down the bottle from which he
had taken a long and grateful drink, but quick as a cat
the boy pulled the door shut, and slipped the bolt on the
outside, and laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this night will you be bridegroom for another
man&rsquo;s wife, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Also it is better that
you put curb on your curses,&ndash;&ndash;for the lady has a mind
for a quiet night of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marto rushed to the curtained window only to find iron
bars and the glint of a gun barrel. Isidro held the gun,
and admonished the storming captive with the gentle
fatalism of the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is done under orders of the major-domo, se&ntilde;or.
There is no other way. If your words are hard or rough
to the ears of the lady, there is a bullet for you, and a
hidden place for your grave. This is the only word to
you, se&ntilde;or. It is given me to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Gods, saints, and devils&ndash;&ndash;hearken you to
me!&rdquo; stormed the man. &ldquo;This is a fool&rsquo;s joke! It can&rsquo;t
go on! I must be back at sunrise&ndash;&ndash;<i>I must!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see many suns rise through these bars if
the padrone so pleases,&rdquo; murmured Isidro gently. &ldquo;That
is not for us to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hottest hell with your padrone and you! Bring
him here to listen to me. This is no affair of a man and
a woman,&ndash;&ndash;curse her witch eyes and their green fires!
There is work afoot,&ndash;&ndash;big work, and I must get back to
Soledad. You know what goes over the trail to Soledad,&ndash;&ndash;every
Indian knows! It is the cache of ammunition
with which to save the peon and Indian slave,&ndash;&ndash;you
know that! You know the revolutionists must get it to
win in Sonora. A trap is set for tomorrow, a big trap! I
must be there to help spring it. To you there will be
riches and safety all your life for my freedom&ndash;&ndash;on the
cross I will swear that. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, nothing is in my power, and of your traps I
know nothing. I am told you set a trap for a lady who
is in grief and your own feet were caught in it. That is
all I know of traps,&rdquo; said Isidro.</p>
<p>Kit patted the old man on the shoulder for cleverness,
even while he wondered at the ravings of the would-be
abductor. Then he crept nearer the window where he
could see the face of the prisoner clearly, and without
the overshadowing hat he had worn on entrance. The
face gave him something to think about, for it was that
of one of the men who had ridden up to the Yaqui spring
the day he had found Tula and Miguel in the desert.
How should this rebel who rode on secret trails with
Ramon Rotil be head man at Soledad for Rotil&rsquo;s enemy?
And what was the trap?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look well at that man, Isidro,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and
tell me if such a man rode here to Mesa Blanca with
General Rotil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such man was here, se&ntilde;or, but this man was foreman
at Soledad before the Deliverer came over the eastern
range to Mesa Blanca. Also the general and Don Jos&eacute;
Perez are known as enemies;&ndash;&ndash;the friend of one cannot
be the friend of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, Isidro, but that does not help me to
understand the trap set. Call your wife and learn if I can
see the Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula had crept up beside them, and touched him on the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asks for you, and sadness is with her very much.
She watches us in fear, and cannot believe that the door
is open for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is her only trouble we can clear it away for
her, <i>pronto</i>,&rdquo; he stated, and they entered the patio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not her only trouble, but of the other she does
not speak. Valencia weeps to look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Is she as bad looking as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is another reason,&rdquo; stated the girl stolidly.
&ldquo;She is a caged humming bird, and her wings have
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes never forgot that first picture of their kidnaped
guest, for he agreed with Clodomiro who saw in
her the living representation of old biblical saints.</p>
<p>The likeness was strengthened by the half Moorish
drapery over her head, a black mantilla which, at sound
of a man&rsquo;s step, she hurriedly drew across the lower part
of her face. Her left arm and shoulder was bare, and
Valencia bent over her with a strip of old linen for
bandage, but the eyes of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta were turned half
shrinking, half appraising to the strange Americano. It
was plain to her that conquering men were merely the
owners of women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good you come, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Valencia. &ldquo;Here
is a wound and the bullet under the skin. I have waited
for Isidro to help but he is slow on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is busy otherwise, but I will call him unless my
own help will serve here. That is for the se&ntilde;ora to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the girl,&ndash;&ndash;she was not more,&ndash;&ndash;never left
his face, and above the lace scarf she peered at him as
through a mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who sent messenger to save an unhappy one
you did not know? You are the Americano of the
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;ora. May that service begin
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It began when that letter was written, and this room
made ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And if you can find the bullet
it will end the unhappiness of this good woman. She
weeps for the little bit of lead. It should have struck a
heart instead of a shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, se&ntilde;ora!&rdquo; lamented Valencia, &ldquo;weep like a
woman over sorrows. It is a better way than to mock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows it is not for me to mock!&rdquo; breathed the
soft voice bitterly. &ldquo;And if the se&ntilde;or will lend you his
aid, I will again be in his debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further words Kit approached, and Valencia
drew the cover from the shoulder and indicated where
the ball could be felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot hold the shoulder and press the flesh there
without making much pain, too much,&rdquo; stated Valencia,
&ldquo;but it must come out, or there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there will,&rdquo; asserted Kit, &ldquo;and if you or Tula
will hold the arm, and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta will pardon me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the white shoulder in his two hands and gently
traced the direction of the bullet. It had struck in the
back and slanted along the shoulder blade. It was evidently
fired from a distance and little force left. Marto
had been much nearer the pursuer, and his was a clean
cut wound through the upper arm.</p>
<p>The girl turned chalky white as he began slowly to
press the bullet backward along its trail, but she uttered
no sound, only a deep intake of breath that was half a
sob, and the cold moisture of sickening pain stood in
beads on her face.</p>
<p>All of the little barriers with a stranger were forgotten,
and the shielding scarf fell away from her face and
bosom, and even with the shadowed emerald eyes closed,
Kit Rhodes thought her the most perfect thing in beauty
he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He hated himself for the pain he was forcing on her
as he steadily followed the bullet upward and upward
until it lay in his hand.</p>
<p>She did not faint, as he feared she might, but fell
back in the chair, while Valencia busied herself with the
ointment and bandage, and Tula, at a word from Kit,
poured her a cup of wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if only a little, se&ntilde;ora. Your
strength has served you well, but it needs help now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swallowed a little of the wine, and drew the scarf
about her, and after a little opened her eyes and looked
at him. He smiled at her approvingly, and offered her
the bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be you will want it to go on some shrine to a
patron saint, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he suggested, but she did not take
it, only looked at him steadily with those wonderful eyes,
green with black lashes, shining out of her marble Madonna-like
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patron saint traveled the trail with you, Se&ntilde;or
Americano, and the bullet is witness. Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave it into her open hand where she balanced it
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So near the mark, yet went aside,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Could that mean there is yet any use left in the world
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty has its own use in the world, se&ntilde;ora; that is
why rose gardens are planted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, se&ntilde;or, though I belong no more to the gardens;&ndash;&ndash;no,
not to gardens, but to the desert. Neither have I
place nor power today, and I may never have, but I give
back to you this witness of your great favor. If a day
comes when I, Jocasta, can give favor in return, bring
or send this witness of the ride tonight. I will redeem it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The favor is to me, and calls for no redemption,&rdquo;
said Kit awkward at the regal poise of her, and enchanted
by the languorous glance and movement of her. Even
the reaching out of her hand made him think of Tula&rsquo;s
words, &lsquo;a humming bird,&rsquo; if one could imagine such a
jewel-winged thing weighted down with black folds of
mourning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A caged humming bird with broken wings!&rdquo; and that
memory brought another thought, and he fumbled the
bullet, and gave the first steady look into those emerald,
side-glancing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;there is a compact I should appreciate if Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta will do me the favor,&ndash;&ndash;and it is that she sets
value on the life that is now her very own, and, that she
forgets not to cherish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; She looked up at him piteously a moment,
and then the long lashes hid her eyes, and her head was
bent low. &ldquo;Sinful and without shame have I been! and
they have told you of the knife I tried to use&ndash;&ndash;here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched her breast with her slender ring-laden
hand, and her voice turned mocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see, Se&ntilde;or Americano, even Death will not
welcome me, and neither steel nor lead will serve me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life will serve you better, se&ntilde;ora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet has it done so, and I am a woman&ndash;&ndash;old&ndash;&ndash;old!
I am twenty, se&ntilde;or, and refused of Death! Jocasta
Benicia they named me. Jocasta Perdida it should have
been to fit the soul of me, so why should I promise a man
whom I do not know that I will cherish my life when I
would not promise a padre? Answer me that, se&ntilde;or
whose name has not been told me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will promise, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; insisted Kit, smiling
a little, though thrilled by the sadness of life&rsquo;s end at
twenty, &ldquo;and as for names, if you are Do&ntilde;a Perdida I
may surely name myself Don Esperenzo, for I have not
only hope, but conviction, that life is worth living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a man, yes, and Mexico is a man&rsquo;s land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, it must be yours as well,&ndash;&ndash;beautiful that thou
art!&rdquo; murmured Valencia adoringly. &ldquo;You should not
give yourself a name of sadness, for this is our Se&ntilde;or El
Pajarito, who is both gay and of honesty. He,&ndash;&ndash;with
God,&ndash;&ndash;is your protection, and harm shall not be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta reached out and touched kindly the bent
head of the Indian woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will, mother. With hope and a singer for a
shield, even a prison would not be so bad, El Pajarito, eh?
Do you make songs&ndash;&ndash;or sing them, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&ndash;&ndash;I am only a lucky bluff. My old partner
and I used to sing fool things to the mules, and as we
could out-bray the burros my Indio friends are kind and
call it a singing;&ndash;&ndash;as easy as that is it to get credit for
talent in this beneficent land of yours! But&ndash;&ndash;the compact,
se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brows lifted wearily, yet the hint of a smile was
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, since you ask so small a thing, it is yours.
Jocasta makes compact with you; give me a wish that the
life is worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will,&rdquo; said Kit holding out his hand, but she
shrunk perceptibly, and her hand crept out of sight in the
black draperies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not, perhaps, ever sent a soul to God without
absolution?&rdquo; she asked in a breathless hushed sort of
voice. &ldquo;No se&ntilde;or, the look of you tells me you have not
been so unpardonable. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; returned Kit, &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t been a habit
with me to start anyone on the angels&rsquo; flight without giving
him time to bless himself, but even at that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; as he took a step nearer. &ldquo;The compact
is ours without handclasp. The hand of Jocasta is the
hand of the black glove, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked from her to the two Indians, the old woman
kneeling beside Jocasta and crossing herself, and Tula,
erect and slender against the adobe wall, watching him
stolidly. There was no light on the subject from either
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, I&rsquo;m but a clumsy Americano, not wise to
your meanings,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;and beautiful hands look
better without gloves of any color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so, yet I have heard that no matter how
handsome a headsman may be, he wears a black mask,
and hands are not stretched out to touch his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, we arrive at nothing when making speech of
me,&rdquo; she said with a little sigh. &ldquo;Our ride was hard, and
rest is best for all of us. Our friend here tells me there
is supper, and if you will eat with me, we will know
more of how all this has come about. It is strange that
you, a lone Americano in this land, should plan this adventure
like a bandit, and steal not only the major-domo
of Soledad, but the woman he would steal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so simple that the matter is not worth words
except as concerns Clodomiro, who was the only one in
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! if ever they had suspected him! You have not
seen that band of men, they are terrible! Of all the men
of Jos&eacute; Perez they are the blackest hearts, and if it had
not been for the poor padre&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me of him,&rdquo; said Kit who perceived she was willing
enough to speak plainly of all things except herself.
&ldquo;He is a good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blessing to me, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; she asserted earnestly as
they were seated at the table so carefully prepared by
Valencia. &ldquo;Look you! I broke away from those animals
and in a little mountain village,&ndash;&ndash;such a one as I was
born in, se&ntilde;or!&ndash;&ndash;I ran to the altar of the little chapel, and
that priest was a shield for me. Against all the men he
spoke curses if they touched me. Well, after that there
was only one task to do, and that was to carry him along.
I think they wanted to kill him, and had not the courage.
And after all that I came away from Soledad without
saving him;&ndash;&ndash;that was bad of me, very bad! I&ndash;&ndash;I think
I went wild in the head when I saw the men play games
of cards, and I to go to the winner! Not even a knife
for food would they give me, for they knew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered, and laid down quickly the knife she had
lifted from beside her plate, and glanced away when she
found him regarding her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been long weeks since I was trusted as you are
trusting me here,&rdquo; she continued quietly. &ldquo;See! On my
wrists were chains at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this Marto Cavayso did that?&rdquo; demanded Kit
as she showed her scarred slender wrist over which
Valencia had wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was before Cavayso&ndash;&ndash;he is a new man&ndash;&ndash;so
I think this was when Conrad was first helping to plan me
as an insane woman and have me put secretly to prison,
but some fear struck Jos&eacute; Perez, and that plan would not
serve. In the dark of night I was half smothered in
wraps and put in an ox-cart of a countryman and hauled
north out of the city. Two men rode as guard. They
chained me in the day and slept, traveling only in the
night until they met Cavayso and his men. After that
I remember little, I was so weary of life! One alcalde
asked about me and Cavayso said I was his wife who had
run away with a gypsy fiddler, and he was taking me
home to my children. Of what use to speak? A dozen
men would have added their testimony to his, and had
sport in making other romance against me. They were
sullen because they thought I had jewels hid under my
clothes, and Cavayso would not let them search me. It
has been hell in these hills of Sonora, Se&ntilde;or Pajarito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easy to understand,&rdquo; agreed Kit wondering
at her endurance, and wondering at the poise and beauty
of her after such experience. There was no trace of
nervousness, or of tears, or self-pity. It was as if all
this of which she told had been a minor affair, dwarfed
by some tragic thing to which he had no key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Conrad was in this plot against you?&rdquo; he asked,
and knew that Tula, standing back of his chair had missed
no word. &ldquo;You mean the German Conrad who is manager
of Granados ranches across the border?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, I mean the beast whose trail is red with the
blood of innocence, and whose poison is sinking into the
veins of Mexico like a serpent, striking secretly, now
here, now there, until the blood of the land is black with
that venom. Ay! I know, se&ntilde;or;&ndash;&ndash;the earth is acrawl
with the German lizards creeping into the shining sun of
Mexico! This so excellent Don Adolf Conrad is only
one, and Jos&eacute; Perez is his target&ndash;&ndash;I am the one to know
that! A year ago, and Don Jos&eacute; was a man, with faults
perhaps; but who is perfect on this earth? Then came
Don Adolf riding south and is very great gentleman and
makes friends. His home in Hermosillo becomes little
by little the house of Perez, and little by little Perez goes
on crooked paths. That is true! First it was to buy a
ship for coast trade, then selling rifles in secret where
they should not be sold, then&ndash;&ndash;shame it is to tell&ndash;&ndash;men
and women were sold and carried on that ship like cattle!
Not rebels, se&ntilde;or, not prisoners of battle,&ndash;&ndash;but herdsmen
and ranch people, poor Indian farmers whom only devils
would harm! Thus it was, se&ntilde;or, until little by little
Don Adolf knew so much that Jos&eacute; Perez awoke to find
he had a master, and a strong one! It was not one man
alone who caught him in the net; it was the German comrades
of Don Adolf who never forgot their task, even
when he was north in the States. They needed a man of
name in Hermosillo, and Jos&eacute; Perez is now that man.
When the whip of the German cracks, he must jump to
serve their will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jos&eacute; Perez is a strong man. Before this day he
has wiped many a man from his trail if the man made
him trouble,&rdquo; ventured Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have right in that, se&ntilde;or, but I am telling you
it is a wide net they spread and in that net he is snared.
Also his household is no longer his own. The Indian
house servants are gone, and outlaw Japanese are there
instead. That is true and their dress is the dress of
Indians. They are Japanese men of crimes, and German
men gave aid that they escape from justice in Japan.
It is because they need such men for German work in
Mexico, men who have been taught German and dare
not turn rebel. Not an hour of the life of Jos&eacute; Perez
is free from the eyes of a spy who is a man of crimes.
And there are other snares. They tell him that he is to
be a governor by their help;&ndash;&ndash;that is a rich bait to float
before the eyes of a man! His feet are set on a trail made
by Adolph Conrad,&ndash;&ndash;He is trapped, and there is no
going back. Poison and shame and slavery and death
have come upon that trail like black mushrooms grown
in a night, and what the end of the trail will be is hid
in the heart of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your sympathy is with those women in slavery
there in the south, and not with the evil friend of Jos&eacute;
Perez?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt, se&ntilde;or? Am I not as truly a victim
as they? I have not worked under a whip, but there are
other punishments&ndash;&ndash;for a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice dropped almost to a whisper, and she rested
her chin on her hand, staring out into the shadows of
the patio, oblivious of them all. Tula gazed at her as
if fascinated, and there was a difference in her regard.
That she was linked in hate against Conrad gave the
Indian girl common cause with the jewel-eyed woman
whose beauty had been the boast of a province. Kit
noticed it and was vastly comforted. The absolute
stolidity of Tula had left him in doubt as to the outcome
if his little partner had disapproved of his fascinating
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. He knew the thing she wanted to know, and
asked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, the last band of Indian slaves from Sonora
were driven from the little pueblo of Palomitas at the
edge of this ranch. And there are sisters and mothers
here with sick hearts over that raid. Can you tell me
where those women were sent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which raid was that, and when?&rdquo; asked Jocasta
arousing herself from some memory in which she had been
submerged. &ldquo;Pardon, se&ntilde;or, I am but a doleful guest at
supper, thinking too deeply of that which sent me here.
Your question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated it, and she strove to remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were many, and no one was told whence they
came. It was supposed they were war prisoners who had
to be fed, and were being sent to grow their own maize.
If it were the last band then it would be the time Conrad
had the wound in the face, here, like a knife thrust, and
that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the time,&rdquo; interrupted Kit eagerly. &ldquo;If
you can tell us where those people were sent you will
prove the best of blessings to Mesa Blanca this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled sadly at that and looked from him to Tula,
whom she evidently noted for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is long since the word of blessing has been given
to Jocasta,&rdquo; she said wistfully. &ldquo;It would be a comfort
to earn it in this house. But that band was not sent away,&ndash;&ndash;not
far. Something went wrong with the boat down
the coast, I forgot what it was, but there was much
trouble, and the Indians were sent to a plantation of the
General Terain until the boat was ready. I do not know
what plantation, except that Conrad raged about it. He
and Don Jos&eacute; had a quarrel, very terrible! That wound
given to him by a woman made him very difficult; then
the quarrel ended by them drinking together too much.
And after that many things happened very fast, and&ndash;&ndash;I
was brought north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, I do not think anyone thought again of those
Indians. They are planting maize or cane somewhere
along the Rio Sonora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula sank down weeping against the wall, while
Valencia stroked her hair and patted her. Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
regarded her curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be young enough to weep like that over a sorrow!&rdquo;
she murmured wistfully. &ldquo;It is to envy her, and
not mourn over her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this weeping is of joy,&rdquo; explained Valencia. &ldquo;It
is as the se&ntilde;or says, a blessing has come with you over the
hard road. This child was also stolen, and was clever
to escape. Her mother and her sister are yet there in
that place where the maize is planted. If the boat has not
taken them, then they also may get back. It is a hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little one! and now that I could make good use
of power, it is no longer mine,&rdquo; said Jocasta, looking at
Kit regretfully. &ldquo;A young maid with courage to escape
has earned the right to be given help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be given it,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;and since
your patience has been great with my questions, I would
ask more of this Cavayso we have trapped tonight. He
is raging of curious things there across the patio. Isidro
holds a gun on him that he subdue his shouts, and his offer
is of rich bribes for quick freedom. He is as mad to get
back to Soledad as he was to leave it, and he tells of a trap
set there for someone. It concerns ammunition for the
revolutionists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not for them, but for trade in the south,&rdquo; said
Jocasta promptly. &ldquo;Yes, Soledad has long been the
place for hiding of arms. It was the task of Don Adolf
to get them across the border, and then a man of Don
Jos&eacute; finds a safe trail for them. Sometimes a German
officer from Tucson is of much help there in the north.
I have heard Don Jos&eacute; and Conrad laugh about the so
easily deceived Americanos,&ndash;&ndash;your pardon, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are used to that,&rdquo; agreed Kit easily, &ldquo;and it is
quite true. We have a whole flock of peace doves up
there helping the Hohenzollern game. What was the
officer&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A name difficult and long,&rdquo; she mused, striving to
recall it. &ldquo;But that name was a secret, and another was
used. He was known only as a simple advocate&ndash;&ndash;James,
the name; I remember that for they told me it was the
English for Diego, which was amusing to me,&ndash;&ndash;there is
no sound alike in them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Kit, who had no special
interest in any advocate named James. &ldquo;But to
get back to the man in the cell over there and the ammunition,
may I ask if he confided to you anything of
that place of storage? I mean Cavayso?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or; and for a reason of the best. He knows
nothing, and all his days and nights were spent searching
secretly for the entrance to that dungeon,&ndash;&ndash;if it is a
dungeon! He thought I should know, and made threats
against me because I would not tell. Myself, I think
Jos&eacute; Perez tells no one that hiding place, not even Conrad,
though Conrad has long wanted it! I told Don Jos&eacute; that
if he told that he was as good as a dead man, and I believe
it. But now,&rdquo; and she shook her head fatefully, &ldquo;now he
is sure to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he swears he must get back to Soledad by sunrise
for a trap is set. A trap for whom?&rdquo; persisted Kit.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta shook her head uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid he should get free to put those wolves on
my track; then indeed I would need a knife, se&ntilde;or! He
held them back from me on the trail, but now he would
not hold them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the trap, se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo; repeated the puzzled Kit.
&ldquo;That man was in earnest,&ndash;&ndash;dead in earnest! He did not
know I was listening, his words were only for an Indian,&ndash;&ndash;for
Isidro. Who could he trap? Was he expecting
anyone at Soledad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta looked up with a little gasp of remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, a courier did come two days ago from the
south, and Cavayso told me he meant to take me to the
desert and hide me before Don Jos&eacute; arrived. Also more
mules and wagons came in. And Elena scolded about
men who came to eat but not to work. Yes, they smoked,
and talked, and talked, and waited! I never thought of
them except to have a great fear. Yesterday after the
lad brought me that letter I had not one thought, but to
count the hours, and watch the sun. But it may be
Cavayso told the truth, and that Don Jos&eacute; was indeed
coming. He told me he had promised Perez to lose me
in the Arroya Maldioso if in no other way, and he had
to manage that I never be seen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arroya Maldioso?&rdquo; repeated Kit, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the great quicksand of Soledad, green things
grow and blossom there but no living thing can cross
over. It is beautiful&ndash;&ndash;that little arroya, and very bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had heard of it, but forgot,&rdquo; acknowledged Kit,
&ldquo;but that is not the trap of which he is raving now. It
is some other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta did not know. She confessed that her
mind was dark and past thinking. The ways of Don
Jos&eacute; and Conrad were not easy for other men of different
lives to understand;&ndash;&ndash;there was a great net of war
and scheming and barter, and Don Jos&eacute; was snared in
that net, and the end no man could see!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard that Marto Cavayso was once
a lieutenant of General Rotil?&rdquo; Kit asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Deliverer!&rdquo; she gasped, leaning forward and
staring at him. A deep flush went over her face and
receded, leaving her as deathly pale as when the bullet
had been forced from the white shoulder. Her regard
was curious, for her brows were contracted and there
was domination and command in her eyes. &ldquo;Why do
you say this to me, se&ntilde;or? And why do you think it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit was astonished at the effect of his words, and quite
as much astonished to hear anyone of the Perez household
refer to Rotil as &ldquo;the Deliverer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, if you saw him ride side by side with Rotil,
drinking from the same cup in the desert, would you not
also think it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula rose to her feet, and moved closer to Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too was seeing them together, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It was at the Yaqui well; I drew the water, and they
drank it. This man of the loud curses is the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta covered her eyes with her hand, and she
seemed shaken. No one else spoke, and the silence was
only broken by the muffled tones of Marto in the cell, and
the brief bark of Clodomiro&rsquo;s dog at the corral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows what may be moving forward,&rdquo; she said
at last, &ldquo;but there is some terrible thing afoot. Take me
to this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be a pleasant thing to do,&rdquo; advised Kit.
&ldquo;This is a man&rsquo;s game, se&ntilde;ora, and his words might offend,
for his rage is very great against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words!&rdquo; she said with a note of disdain, and arose
to her feet. She swayed slightly, and Valencia steadied
her, and begged her to wait until morning, for her
strength was gone and the night was late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, woman! Who of us is sure of a morning?
This minute is all the time that is ours, and&ndash;&ndash;I must
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned on Valencia as they crossed the patio, and
Tula moved a seat outside the door of Marto&rsquo;s room. Kit
fastened a torch in the holder of the brick pillar and
opened the door without being seen, and stood watching
the prisoner.</p>
<p>Marto Cavayso, who had been pleading with Isidro,
whirled only to find the barrel of another gun thrust
through the carved grill in the top of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isidro,&rdquo; said Kit, &ldquo;this man is to answer questions
of the se&ntilde;ora. If he is uncivil you can singe him with
a bullet at your own will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; returned Isidro promptly.
&ldquo;That is a pleasant work to think of, for the talk of this
shameless gentleman is poison to the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; burst out Marto, pointing a hand at Jocasta in
the corridor. &ldquo;You put witchcraft of hell on me, and
wall me in here with an old lunatic for guard, and
now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bing! A bullet from Isidro&rsquo;s rifle whistled past Marto&rsquo;s
ear and buried itself in the adobe, scattering plaster
and causing the prisoner to crouch back in the corner.</p>
<p>Jocasta regarded him as if waiting further speech, but
none came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No one wishes to do you
harm, but you need a lesson very badly. Now Marto
Cavayso,&ndash;&ndash;if that be your name!&ndash;&ndash;why did you carry me
away? Was it your own doing, or were you under orders
of your General Rotil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have let the men have you,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
was a bewitched man, or you never would have traveled
alive to see Soledad. Rotil? Do not the handsome women
everywhere offer him love and comradeship? Would
he risk a good man to steal a woman of whom Jos&eacute; Perez
is tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not the one to give judgment,&rdquo; said a strange
voice outside the barred window.&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;That I did not
send you to steal women is very true, and the task I did
send you for has been better done by other men in your
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cavayso swore, and sat on the bed, his head in his
hands. Outside the window there were voices in friendly
speech, that of Clodomiro very clear as he told his grandfather
the dogs did not bark but once, because some of
the Mesa Blanca boys were with the general, who was
wounded.</p>
<p>Kit closed and bolted again the door of Cavayso, feeling
that the guardianship of beauty in Sonora involved
a man in many awkward and entangling situations. If
it was indeed Rotil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But a curious choking moan in the corridor caused him
to turn quickly, but not quickly enough.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, who had been as a reed of steel against
other dangers, had risen to her feet as if for flight at
sound of the voice, and she crumpled down on the floor
and lay, white as a dead woman, in a faint so deep that
even her heartbeat seemed stilled.</p>
<p>Kit gathered her up, limp as a branch of willow, and
preceded by Tula with the torch, bore her back to the
chamber prepared for her. Valencia swept back the
covers of the bed, and with many mutterings of fear
and ejaculations to the saints, proceeded to the work of
resuscitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that she came over that black road and held
fast to a heart of bravery,&ndash;&ndash;and now at a word from the
Deliverer, she falls dead in fear! So it is with many who
hear his name; yet he is not bad to his friends. Every
Indian in Sonora is knowing that,&rdquo; stated Valencia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE HAWK OF THE SIERRAS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what we get, Tula, by gathering beauty in
distress into our outfit,&rdquo; sighed Kit. &ldquo;She seems
good foundation for a civil war here. Helen of Troy,&ndash;&ndash;a
lady of an eastern clan!&ndash;&ndash;started a war on less, and the
cards are stacked against us if they start scrapping.
When Mexican gentry begin hostilities, the innocent bystander
gets the worst of it,&ndash;&ndash;especially the Americano.
So it is just as well the latest Richard in the field does
not know whose bullet hit him in the leg, and brought his
horse down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula, who since their entrance to the civilized surroundings
of Mesa Blanca, had apparently dropped all
initiative, and was simply a little Indian girl under orders,
listened impassively to this curious monologue. She
evidently thought white people use many words for a
little meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Deliverer says will you graciously come?&rdquo; she
stated for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither graciously, gracefully or gratefully, but I&rsquo;ll
arrive,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;His politeness sounds ominous.
It is puzzling why I, a mere trifle of an American ranch
hand, should be given audience instead of his distinguished
lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isidro and Clodomiro are talking much with him, and
the man Marto is silent, needing no guard,&rdquo; said Tula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&ndash;&ndash;Rotil has the whole show buffaloed. Well,
let&rsquo;s hope, child, that he is not a mind reader, for we have
need of all the ore we brought out, and can&rsquo;t spare any for
revolutionary subscriptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit followed Tula into the <i>sala</i> where a rawhide cot
had been placed, and stretched on it was the man of Yaqui
Spring.</p>
<p>One leg of his trousers was ripped up, and there was the
odor of a greasewood unguent in the room. Isidro was
beside him, winding a bandage below the knee. A yellow
silk banda around the head of Rotil was stained with
red.</p>
<p>But he had evidently been made comfortable, for he
was rolling a cigarette and was calling Isidro &ldquo;doctor.&rdquo;
Two former vaqueros of Mesa Blanca were there, and
they nodded recognition to Kit. Rotil regarded him with
a puzzled frown, and then remembered, and waved his
hand in salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, se&ntilde;or, we meet again!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
told that you are my host and the friend of Se&ntilde;or
Whitely. What is it you do here? Is it now a prison, or
a hospital for unfortunates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a hospital for you, General, and I trust a serviceable
one,&rdquo; Kit hastened to assure him. &ldquo;More of comfort
might have been yours had you sent a courier to permit
of preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The service is of the best,&rdquo; and Rotil pointed to
Isidro. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to take him along, old as he is!
The boys told me he was the best medico this side the
range, and I believe it. As to courier,&rdquo; and he grinned,
&ldquo;I think you had one, if you had read the message right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surprises of the night were confusing, and a simple
man could not dare prophesy what might follow,&rdquo; said
Kit, who had drawn up a chair and easily fell into Rotil&rsquo;s
manner of jest. &ldquo;But I fancy if that courier had known
who would follow after, he would have spent the night by
preference at Soledad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he would,&ndash;&ndash;hell&rsquo;s fire shrivel him! That shot of
his scraped a bone for me, and put my horse out of business.
For that reason we came on quietly, and these good
fellows listened at the window of Marto before they carried
me in. It is a good joke on me. My men rounded
up Perez and his German slaver at Soledad today&ndash;&ndash;yesterday
now!&ndash;&ndash;and when we rode up the little ca&ntilde;on
to be in at the finish what did we see but an escape with
a woman? Some word had come my way of a Perez
woman there, and only one thought was with me, that
the woman had helped Perez out of the trap as quickly
as he had ridden into it! After that there was nothing
to do but catch them again. No thought came to me that
Marto might be stealing a woman for himself, the fool!
Perez made better time than we figured on, and is a day
ahead. Marto meant to hide the woman and get back
in time. It&rsquo;s a great joke that an Americano took the
woman from him. I hope she is worth the trouble,&rdquo;
and he smiled, lifting his brows questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was the &lsquo;trap&rsquo; that Marto raved and stormed
to get back to?&rdquo; remarked Kit. &ldquo;I am still in the dark,
though there are some glimmers of light coming. If
Marto knew of that trap it explains&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three others of my men on the Soledad
rancho, drawing pay from Perez. It is the first time
that fox came in when we could spread the net tight. To
get him at another place would not serve so well, for if
Soledad was the casket of our treasure, at Soledad we
make a three strike,&ndash;&ndash;the cattle, the ammunition, and
Perez there to show the hiding place! It is the finish of
four months&rsquo; trailing, and is worth the time, and but for
Marto running loco over a girl, there would have been a
beautiful quiet finish at Soledad ranch house last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if your men have Perez&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like that!&rdquo; and Rotil stretched out his open hand,
and closed it significantly, with a cruel smile in his black,
swift-glancing eyes. &ldquo;This time there is no mistake.
For over a week men and stout mules have been going
in;&ndash;&ndash;it is a <i>conducta</i> and it is to take the ammunition.
Well, se&ntilde;or, it is all well managed for me; also we have
much need of that ammunition for our own lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was done without a fight?&rdquo; asked Kit. &ldquo;I
have heard that the men picked for Soledad were not
the gentlest band Se&ntilde;or Perez could gather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had their number,&rdquo; said Rotil placidly. &ldquo;Good
men enough, but with their cartridges doctored what
could they do? I sent in two machine guns, and they
were not needed. A signal smoke went up to show me
all was well, and in another minute I heard the horses
of Marto and his girl. He must have started an hour
before Perez arrived. It is a trick of Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s that
no one can count on his engagements, but this time every
hill had its sentinels for his trail, not anything was left
to chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your accident?&rdquo; asked Kit politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was setting my own guards at every pass when
the runaway woman and men caught my ear and we took
a short cut down the little ca&ntilde;on to head them off. I
knew they would make for here, and that houses were not
plenty&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he smiled as if well satisfied with the knowledge.
&ldquo;So, as this was a friendly house it would be a
safe bet to keep on coming.&rdquo; He blew rings of smoke
from the cigarette, and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys will think a quicksand has swallowed us,
and no one will be sleeping there at Soledad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do to be of service,&rdquo; asked
Kit. &ldquo;I have a good room and a bed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the chuckling of Rotil broke into a frank laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; he said with humorous decision, watching
Kit as he spoke, &ldquo;already I have been told of your
great kindness in the giving of beds and rooms of comfort.
Why, with a house big enough, you could jail all
the district of Altar! Not my head for a noose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit laughed awkwardly at the jest which was based on
fact, but he met the keen eyes of Rotil very squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians no doubt told you the reason the jail was
needed?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If a girl picks a man to take a trail
with, that is her own affair and not mine, but if a girl
with chains on her wrists has to watch men throwing dice
for her, and is forced to go with the winner&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;the
man who would not help set her free needs a dose of lead.
That is our American way, and no doubt is yours, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Let a woman pick her own, if she can find
him!&rdquo; agreed Rotil, and then he grinned again as he
looked at Kit. &ldquo;And, se&ntilde;or, it is a safe bet that this
time she&rsquo;ll find him!&ndash;&ndash;you are a good big mark, not easily
hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other men smiled and nodded at the humor of
their chief, and regarded Kit with appreciative sympathy.
It was most natural of course for them to suppose that
if he took a woman from Marto, he meant to win her
for himself.</p>
<p>Kit smiled back at them, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck for a poor vaquero,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;The lady is in mourning, and much grief. She is like
some saint of sorrows in a priest&rsquo;s tale, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priests are liars, and invented hell,&rdquo; stated Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but sometimes we see sad women of
prayers who look like the saints the priests tell about,&ndash;&ndash;and
to have such women sold by a gambler is not good
to hear of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke for a little. The eyes of Rotil closed
in a curious, contemptuous smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are young, boy,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and even we
who are not so young are often fooled by women. Trust
any woman of the camp rather than the devout saints
of the shrines. All are for market,&ndash;&ndash;but you pay most
for the saint, and sorrow longest for her. And you never
forget that the shrine is empty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was mocking and harsh, but Kit preferred to
ignore the sudden change of manner for which there
seemed no cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the warning, General, and no saints for
me!&rdquo; he said good naturedly. &ldquo;Now, is there any practical
thing I can do to add to your comfort here? Any
plans for tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of mine is already on the way to Soledad, and
we will sleep before other plans are made. Not even
Marto will I see tonight, knowing well that you have
seen to his comfort!&rdquo; and he chuckled again at the
thought of Marto in his luxurious trap. &ldquo;My lads will
do guard duty in turn, and we sleep as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if I can be of no service&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow perhaps, not tonight, se&ntilde;or. Some sleep
will do us no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good night, and good rest to you, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, and good night, Don Pajarito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit laughed at that sally, and took himself out of
the presence. It was plain that the Deliverer had obtained
only the most favorable account of Kit as the friend of
Whitely. And as an American lad who sang songs, and
protected even women he did not know, he could not appear
formidable to Rotil&rsquo;s band, and certainly not in need
of watching.</p>
<p>He looked back at them as the general turned on
his side to sleep, and one of his men blew out the two
candles, and stationed themselves outside the door. As
he noted the care they took in guarding him, and glanced
at the heavy doors and barred windows, he had an uncomfortable
thrill at the conviction that it would serve
as a very efficient prison for himself if his new friends,
the revolutionists, ever suspected he held the secret of
the red gold of El Alisal. It was a bit curious that the
famous lost mine of the old mission had never really been
&ldquo;lost&rdquo; at all!</p>
<p>Isidro, looking very tired, had preceded him from
the <i>sala</i>, as Kit supposed to go to bed. The day and night
had been trying to the old man, and already it was the
small hours of a new day.</p>
<p>There was a dim light in the room of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,
but no sound. Tula was curled up on a blanket outside
her door like a young puppy on guard. He stooped and
touched her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep, after tears, and a sad heart!&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Valencia thanks the saints that at last she weeps,&ndash;&ndash;the
beautiful sad one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well; go you also to sleep. Your friends keep
guard tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply, and he passed on along the corridor
to his own rooms. The door was open, and he was
about to strike a light when a hand touched his arm.
He drew back, reaching for his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; whispered Isidro, &ldquo;make no light, and make
your words in whispers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;ora and the Deliverer. Know you not, se&ntilde;or,
that she is sick with shame? It is so. No man has told
him who the woman is he calls yours. All are afraid,
se&ntilde;or. It is said that once Ramon Rotil was content
to be a simple man with a wife of his own choosing,
but luck was not his. It was the daughter of a priest in the
hills, and Jos&eacute; Perez took her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; breathed Kit. &ldquo;If it should be this one&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&ndash;&ndash;she went like a dead woman at his voice,
but he does not know. How should he, when Don Jos&eacute;
has women beyond count? Se&ntilde;or, my Valencia promised
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta you would save her from meeting the
general. That promise was better than a sleeping drink
of herbs to her. Now that the promise is made, how
will you make it good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy smoke&ndash;&ndash;also incense&ndash;&ndash;also the pipe!&rdquo; muttered
Kit in the dark. &ldquo;If I live to get out of this muddle
I&rsquo;ll swear off all entangling alliances forevermore!
Come into the kitchen where we can have a fire&rsquo;s light.
I can&rsquo;t think in this blackness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way to the kitchen, and started a blaze
with mesquite bark. The old Indian cut off some strips
of burro <i>jerke</i> and threw them on the coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better, it&rsquo;s an occupation anyway,&rdquo; conceded
Kit chewing with much relish. &ldquo;Now, Isidro, man, you
must go on. You know the land best. How is one to
hide a woman of beauty from desert men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have a plan,&rdquo; suggested Isidro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Clodomiro?&rdquo; asked Kit, suddenly recalling
that the boy had disappeared. The old man did not
answer; he was very busy with the fire, and when the
question was repeated he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know who went. If Tula did not go, then
Clodomiro was the one. They were talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking,&ndash;&ndash;about what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the German. He is caught at Soledad, and
must not be let go, or let die. All the Indians of Palomitas
will be asking the Deliverer for that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isidro, what is it they want to do with him?&rdquo; asked
Kit, and the old Indian ceased fussing around with a stick
in the ashes, and looked up, sinister and reproving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, se&ntilde;or, is a question a man does not ask. If
my woman tells me the women want a man for Judas,
I&ndash;&ndash;get that man! I ask nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! And that child, Tula&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Kit
in consternation, and old Isidro nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Tula who asked. She is proving she is a woman;
Clodomiro goes for her because that is his work. Your
white way would be a different way,&ndash;&ndash;of an alcalde and
the word of many witness. Our women have their own
way, and no mistake is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rotil, the general,&ndash;&ndash;he will not permit&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, for either mother or grandmother the general
had an Indian woman. He has the knowing of these
things. I think Tula gets the man they ask for. She is
wise, that child! A good woman will be chosen to have
speech with the Deliverer&ndash;&ndash;when they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a thought in that,&rdquo; mused Kit, glancing
sharply at the old man. &ldquo;Do they make choice of some
wise woman, to be speaker for the others? And they
come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how it is, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what better way to hide Do&ntilde;a Jocasta than to
place her among Indian women who come in a band for
that task? Many women veil and shroud their heads in
black as she does. The music of her voice was dulled
when she spoke to Marto, and General Rotil had no
memory of having ever heard it. Think,&ndash;&ndash;is there to be
found an old dress of your wife? Can it be done and
trust no one? Do&ntilde;a Jocasta is clever when her fear is
gone. With Tula away from that door the rest is easy.
The dawn is not so far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawn is the time the women of Palomitas will take
the road,&rdquo; decided Isidro, &ldquo;for by the rising time of
the sun the Deliverer has said that his rest here is ended,
and he goes on to Soledad where Jos&eacute; Perez will have a
trembling heart of waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they tell him whose trap he is caught in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? The Deliverer has plans of his own
making. It was not for idleness he was out of sight
when the trap was sprung. He sleeps little, does Ramon
Rotil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a mesquite tree by the cook house chickens began
to crow a desultory warning. And Isidro proceeded to
subtract stealthily a skirt and shawl from wooden pegs
set in the adobe wall where Valencia slept. She startled
him by stirring, and making weary inquiry as to whether
it was the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my treasure, that fighting cock of Clodomiro
crows only because of a temper, and not for day. It is I
will make the fire and set Maria to the grinding. Go you
to your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which Valencia was glad to do, while her holiday
wardrobe, a purple skirt bordered with green, and a deeply
fringed black shawl, was confiscated for the stranger
within their gates.</p>
<p>Thrusting the bundle back of an olla in the corridor
he touched Tula on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;or waits you in the kitchen,&rdquo; he muttered in
the Indian tongue, and she arose without a word, and
went silent as a snake along the shadowy way.</p>
<p>It took courage for Isidro to enter alone the room of
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, as that was the business of a woman.
But Kit had planned that, if discovered, the girl should
apparently have no accomplices. This would protect Tula
and Valencia should Rotil suspect treachery if an occupant
of the house should disappear. It would seem most
natural that a stolen woman would seek to escape homeward
when not guarded, and that was to serve as a reasonable
theory.</p>
<p>She slept with occasional shuddering sighs, as a child
after sobbing itself to sleep. That sad little sound gave
the old Indian confidence in his errand. It might mean
trouble, but she had dared trouble ere now. And there
could not be continual sorrow for one so beautiful, and
this might be the way out!</p>
<p>She woke with a startled cry as he shook her bed, but
it was quickly smothered as he whispered her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is best you go to pray in the chapel room, and
meet there the women of Palomitas. Others will go to
pray for a Judas; among many you may be hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She patted his arm, and arose in the dark, slipping on
her clothes. He gave her the skirt and she donned that
over her own dress. Her teeth were chattering with
nervous excitement, and when she had covered herself
with the great shawl, her hand went out gropingly to
him to lead her.</p>
<p>As they did not pass the door of the <i>sala</i>, no notice was
given them by Rotil&rsquo;s guard. Mexican women were ever
at early prayers, or at the <i>metate</i> grinding meal for breakfast,
and that last possibility was ever welcome to men
on a trail.</p>
<p>In the kitchen Kit Rhodes was seeking information
concerning Clodomiro from Tula, asking if it was true he
would fetch the women of Palomitas to petition Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; she conceded, &ldquo;but that work is not for
a mind of a white man. Thus I am not telling you
Clodomiro is the one to go; his father was what you
call a priest,&ndash;&ndash;but not of the church,&rdquo; she said hastily,
&ldquo;no, of other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at her elfin young face in the flickering light
of the hearth fire, he had a realization of vast vistas of
&ldquo;other things&rdquo; leading backward in her inherited tendencies,
the things known by his young comrade but
not for the mind of a white man,&ndash;&ndash;not even for the man
whom Miguel had trusted with the secret of El Alisal.
Gold might occasionally belong to a very sacred shrine,
but even sacred gold was not held so close in sanctuary
as certain ceremonies dear to the Indian thought. Without
further words Kit Rhodes knew that there were
locked chambers in the brain of his young partner, and
to no white man would be granted the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since he has gone for them, there is nothing
to say, though the general may be ill pleased at visitors,&rdquo;
hazarded Kit. &ldquo;Also you and I know why we should
keep all the good will coming our way, and risk none of
it on experiments. Go you back to your rest since there
is not anything to be done. Clodomiro is at Palomitas
by now, and you may as well sleep while the dawn is
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the strip of roasted meat he offered her, and
went back to her blanket on the tiles at the door of the
now empty room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE &ldquo;JUDAS&rdquo; PRAYER AT MESA BLANCA</h3>
</div>
<p>Isidro was right when he said Ramon Rotil slept but
little, for the very edge of the dawn was scarce showing
in the east when he opened his eyes, moved his
wounded leg stiffly, and then lay there peering between
half-shut eyelids at the first tint of yellow in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chappo,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;look beyond through that
window. Is it a band of horses coming down the mesa
trail, or is it men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, my General, it is the women who are left
of the rancherias of Palomitas. They come to do a
prayer service at an old altar here. Once Mesa Blanca
was a great hacienda with a chapel for the peons, and
they like to come. It is a custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What saint&rsquo;s day is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not wise enough, General, to remember all;&ndash;&ndash;our
women tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&ndash;&ndash;saint&rsquo;s day unknown, and all a pueblo on a
trail to honor it! Call Fidelio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a whistle, a quick tread, and one of the men
of Palomitas stood in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take two men and search every woman coming for
prayers&ndash;&ndash;guns have been carried under <i>serapes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, General&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search every woman,&ndash;&ndash;even though your own
mother be of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General, my own mother is already here, and on
her knees beyond there in the altar room. They pray
for heart to ask of you their rights in Soledad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is some joke, and it is too early in the morning
for jokes with me. I&rsquo;m too empty. What have Palomitas
women to do with rights in Soledad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been told,&rdquo; said Fidelio evasively. &ldquo;It is
a woman matter. But as to breakfast, it is making, and
the <i>tortillas</i> already baking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order all ready, and a long stirrup for that leg,&rdquo; said
the general, moving it about experimentally. &ldquo;It is not
so bad, but Marto can ride fasting to Soledad for giving
it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my General, he asks&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he to ask? After yesterday, silence is best
for him. Take him along. I will decide later if he is of
further use&ndash;&ndash;I may&ndash;&ndash;need&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something deliberately threatening in his
slow speech, and the guards exchanged glances. Without
doubt there would be executions at Soledad!</p>
<p>Rotil got off the cot awkwardly, but disdaining help
from the guards hopped to a chair against the wall between
the two windows.</p>
<p>Isidro came in with a bowl of water, and a much embroidered
towel for the use of the distinguished guest,
followed by a vaquero with smoking <i>tortillas</i>, and Tula
with coffee.</p>
<p>The general eyed the ornate drawnwork of the linen
with its cobweb fingers, and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a bridegroom this morning, <i>muchachita</i>, and
need no necktie of such fineness for my beauty. Bring
a plainer thing, or none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula&rsquo;s eyes lit up with her brief smile of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am telling them you are a man and want no child
things, my General,&rdquo; she stated firmly, &ldquo;and now it
proves itself! On the instant the right thing comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She darted out the door, bumping into Rhodes, and
without even the customary &ldquo;with your permission&rdquo; ran
past him along the corridor, and, suddenly cautious, yet
bold, she lifted the latch of the guest room where she
had seen what looked to her like wealth of towels,&ndash;&ndash;and
felt sure Do&ntilde;a Jocasta would not miss one of the plainest.</p>
<p>Stealthy as a cat she circled the bed, scarce daring to
glance at it lest the lady wake and look reproach on her.</p>
<p>But she stepped on some hard substance on the rug by
the wooden bench where the towels hung, and stooping,
she picked it up, a little wooden crucifix, once broken, and
then banded with silver to hold it solid. The silver was
beautifully wrought and very delicate, surely the possession
of a lady, and not a thing let fall by chance from the
pocket of Valencia.</p>
<p>Tula turned to lay it carefully on the pillow beside the
se&ntilde;ora, and then stared at the vacant bed.</p>
<p>Only an instant she halted and thrust her hand under
the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold,&ndash;&ndash;long time cold!&rdquo; she muttered, and with towel
and crucifix she sped back to the <i>sala</i> where Rotil was
joking concerning the compliment she paid him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make dandies of yourselves if you would make
good with a woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even that little crane
of a <i>muchacha</i> has brain,&ndash;&ndash;and maybe heart for a man!
She has boy sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit, seeing her dart into the guest room, stood in his
tracks watching for her to emerge. She gave him one
searching curious look as she sped past, and he realized
in a flash that his glance should have been elsewhere,
or at least more casual.</p>
<p>She delivered the towel and retired, abashed and silent
at the jests of the man she regarded with awe as the god-sent
deliverer of her people. Once in the corridor she
looked into Valencia&rsquo;s room, then in the kitchen where
Valencia and Maria and other women were hastening
breakfast, and last she sought Clodomiro at the corral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you take her, and how?&rdquo; she demanded,
and the youth, tired with the endless rides and tasks of
two days and nights, was surly, and looked his impatience.
&ldquo;She, and she, and she! Always women!&rdquo; he grumbled.
&ldquo;Have I not herded all of them from over the mesa at
your order? Is one making a slow trail, and must I go
herding again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, but looked past him at the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which did the se&ntilde;ora ride from Soledad?&rdquo; she inquired,
and Clodomiro pointed out a mare of shining
black, and also a dark bay ridden by Marto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust him to take the best of the saddle herd,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Why have you come about it? Is the se&ntilde;ora
wanting that black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so; I was not told,&rdquo; she answered evasively.
&ldquo;But there is early breakfast, and it is best to get your
share before some quick task is set,&ndash;&ndash;and this day there
are many tasks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women were entering the portal at the rear, because
the chapel of the old hacienda was at the corner.
There was considerable commotion as Fidelio enforced
the order to search for arms;&ndash;&ndash;if the Deliverer suspected
treachery, how could they hope for the sympathy they
came to beg for?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him there is nothing hidden under our rags but
hearts of sorrow,&rdquo; said the mother of Fidelio. &ldquo;Ask
that he come here where we kneel to give God thanks that
El Aleman is now in the power of the Deliverer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Rotil does not walk, and there is no room
for a horse in this door. Someone of you must speak
for the others, and go where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kneeling women looked at each other with troubled
dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valencia will be the best one,&rdquo; said an old woman.
&ldquo;She lost no one by the pale beast, but she knows us
every one. Marta, who was wife of Miguel, was always
mother and spoke for us to the padre, or anyone, but
Marta&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and shook her head; some women wept.
All knew Marta was one who cried to them for vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Valencia. &ldquo;Marta was the best,
but the child of Marta is here, and knows more than we.
She has done much,&ndash;&ndash;more than many women. I think
the daughter can speak best for the mother, and that the
Deliverer will listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula had knelt like the others, facing a little shelf on
the wall where a carven saint was dimly illuminated by
the light of a candle. All the room was very dark, for
the dawn was yet but as a gray cloak over the world, and
no window let in light.</p>
<p>The girl stood up and turned toward Valencia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because it is my work to go
when you speak, but the Deliverer will ask for older
tongues and I will come back to tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without hesitation she walked out of the door, and
the others bent their heads and there was the little click-click
of rosary beads, slipping through their fingers in
the dusk. Among the many black-shawled huddled figures
kneeling on the hard tiles, none noticed the one girl
in the corner where shadows were deepest, and whose
soft slender hands were muffled in Valencia&rsquo;s fringes.</p>
<p>Kit stood until he noted that the searching for arms
did not include her, and then crossed the patio with
Fidelio on his way to the corrals. If the black mare of
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta could be gotten to the rear portal, together
with the few burros of the older women, she might follow
after unnoticed. The adobe wall at the back was over
ten feet high and would serve as a shield, and the entire
cavalcade would be a half mile away ere they came in
range from the plaza.</p>
<p>He planned to manage that the mare be there without
asking help of any Indian, and he thought he could do
it while the guard was having breakfast. It would be
easy for them to suppose that the black was his own.
Thus scheming for beauty astray in the desert, he chatted
with Fidelio concerning the pilgrimage of the Palomitas
women, and the possibility of Rotil&rsquo;s patience with them,
when Tula crossed the patio hurriedly and entered the
door of the <i>sala</i>.</p>
<p>The general was finishing his breakfast, while Isidro
was crouched beside him rewinding the bandage after
a satisfactory inspection of the wound. The swelling was
not great, and Rotil, eating cheerfully, was congratulating
himself on having made a straight trail to the physician
of Mesa Blanca; it was worth a lost day to have
the healing started right.</p>
<p>He was in that complacent mood when Tula sped on
silent bare feet through the <i>sala</i> portal, and halted just
inside, erect against the wall, gazing at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hola! <i>Ni&ntilde;a</i> who has the measure of a man! The
coffee was of the best. What errand is now yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency, it is the errand too big for me, yet I am
the one sent with it. They send me because the mother
of me, and Anita, my sister, were in the slave drive south,
and the German and the Perez men carried whips and
beat the women on that trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brave young heart seemed to creep up in her throat
and choke her at thought of those whips and the women
who were driven, for her voice trembled into silence,
and she stood there swallowing, her head bent, and her
hands crossed over her breast, and clasped firmly there
was the crucifix she had found in the guest room. Little
pagan that she was, she regarded it entirely as a fetish of
much potency with white people, and surely she needed
help of all gods when she spoke for the whole pueblo to
this man who had power over many lives.</p>
<p>Rotil stared at her, frowning and bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began, but Isidro looked up at
him and nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a truth she is telling, Excellency. Her father
was Miguel, once major-domo of this rancho. He died
from their fight, and his women were taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that!&ndash;&ndash;it happens in many states. But this
German&ndash;&ndash;who says the German and Perez were the
men to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Tula, child of Miguel, say it,&rdquo; stated the girl.
&ldquo;With my eyes I saw him,&ndash;&ndash;with my ears I heard the
sister call out his name. The name was Don Adolf.
Over his face was tied a long beard, so! But it was the
man,&ndash;&ndash;the friend of Don Jos&eacute; Perez of Soledad; all are
knowing that. He is now your man, and the women ask
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the women of Palomitas. On their knees in the
chapel they make prayers. Excellency, it robs you of
nothing that you give them a Judas for Holy Week. I
am sent to ask that of the Deliverer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slid down to her knees on the tiles, and looked up
at him.</p>
<p>He stared at her, frowning and eyeing her intently,
then chuckled, and grinned at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you she had the heart of a boy? And
now you see it! Get up off your knees, <i>chiquita</i>. Why
should you want a Judas? It is a sweetheart I must find
for you instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not getting up,&rdquo; said Tula stolidly. &ldquo;I am kneeling
before you, my General. See! I pray to you on the
tiles for that Judas. All the women are praying. Also
the old women have made medicine to send El Aleman
once more on this trail, and see you,&ndash;&ndash;it has come to pass!
You have him in your trap, but he is ours. Excellency,
come once and see all the women on their knees before
the saint as I am here by you. We make prayers for
one thing:&ndash;&ndash;the Judas for our holy day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young devil!&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;I wish you were
a boy. Here, you men help me, or get me a crutch. I
will see these women on their knees, and if you don&rsquo;t
lie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the help of Fidelio and a cane, he started very
well, and nodded to Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pick well, amigo,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;She is a wildcat,
and of interest. Come you and see. <i>Por Dios!</i>
I&rsquo;ve seen a crucifixion of the Penitentes and helped dig
the hidden grave. Also I have heard of the &lsquo;Judas&rsquo;
death on Holy Friday, but never before this has so young
a woman creature picked a man for it,&ndash;&ndash;a man alive!
Courage of the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula arose, and went before them across the plaza to
the door of the chapel. Kit knew this was the right moment
for him to disappear and get the black mare back
of the wall, but Rotil kept chuckling to him over the
ungirlish request, and so pointedly included him in the
party that there seemed no excuse available for absenting
himself.</p>
<p>A flush of rose swept upward to the zenith heralding
the sun, but in the adobe room, with its door to the west,
no light came, except by dim reflection, and as Tula entered
and the men stood at the threshold, they blocked
the doorway of even that reflection, and the candle at the
saint&rsquo;s shrine shone dimly over the bent heads of the
kneeling women.</p>
<p>Rotil stood looking about questioningly; he had not
expected to see so many. Then at the sound of the click
of the prayer beads, some recollection of some past caused
him to automatically remove his wide-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mothers,&rdquo; said Tula quietly, &ldquo;the Deliverer has
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a half-frightened gasp, and dark faces
turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He comes as I told you, because I am no one by myself,
and he could not know I was sent by you. I am
not anyone among people, and he does not believe. Only
people of importance should speak with a soldier who
is a general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>por Dios</i>, my boy, you speak well!&rdquo; said Rotil,
clapping his hand on her shoulder, &ldquo;but your years are
not many and it cannot be you know the thing you ask
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; asserted Tula with finality.</p>
<p>An old woman got up stiffly, and came towards him.
&ldquo;We are very poor, yet even our children are robbed
from us&ndash;&ndash;that is why we pray. Don Ramon, your
mother was simple as we, and had heart for the poor.
Our lives are wasted for the masters, and our women
children are stolen for the sons of masters. That is done,
and we wish they may find ways to kill themselves on
the trail. But the man who drove them with whips is
now your man&ndash;&ndash;and we mothers ask him of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizened old creature trembled as she spoke, and
scarce lifted her eyes. She made effort to speak further,
but words failed, and she slipped to her knees and the
beads slid from her nervous fingers to the tiles. She was
very old, and she had come fasting across the mesa in
the chill before the dawn; her two grandchildren had
been driven south with the slaves&ndash;&ndash;one had been a bride
but a month&ndash;&ndash;and they killed her man as they took
her.</p>
<p>Valencia came to her and wiped the tears from her
cheeks, patting her on the back as one would soothe a
child, and then she looked at Rotil, nodding her head
meaningly, and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all true as Tia Tomasa is saying, se&ntilde;or. Her
children are gone, and this child of Capitan Miguel
knows well what she asks for. The days of the sorrows
of Jesus are coming soon, and the Judas we want for
that day of the days will not be made of straw to be
bound on the wild bull&rsquo;s back, and hung when the ride
is over. No, se&ntilde;or, we know the Judas asked of you
by this daughter of Miguel;&ndash;&ndash;it is the pale beast called
El Aleman. For many, many days have we made prayers
like this, before every shrine, that the saints would send
him again to our valley. You, se&ntilde;or, have brought answer
to that prayer. You have him trapped, but he
belongs only to us women. The saints listened to us,
and you are in it. Men often are in prayers like that, and
have no knowing of it, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit listened in amazement to this account of prayers
to Mexican saints for a Judas to hang on Good Friday!
After four centuries of foreign priesthood, and foreign
saints on the shrines, the mental effect on the aborigines
had not risen above crucifixion occasionally on some
proxy for their supreme earthly god, or mad orgies of
vengeance on a proxy for Judas. The great drama of
Calvary had taught them only new forms of torture and
the certainty that vengeance was a debt to be paid. Conrad
was to them the pale beast whipping women into
slavery,&ndash;&ndash;and as supreme traitor to human things must
be given a Judas death!</p>
<p>He shivered as he listened, and looked at the eyes of
women staring out of the dusk for the answer to their
prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por Dios!</i>&rdquo; muttered Rotil, half turning to Kit, yet
losing nothing of the pleading strained faces. &ldquo;Does
your head catch all of that, se&ntilde;or? Can&rsquo;t women beat
hell? And women breed us all! What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case it&rsquo;s up to you, General,&rdquo; replied Kit.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the responsibility is not mine. Even as it is,
women who look like these are likely to walk through my
dreams for many a night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil gloomed at them, puzzled, frowning, and at times
the flicker of a doubtful smile would change his face
without lighting it. No one moved or spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;this child and two women
have spoken, but there are over twenty of you here.
Three out of twenty is no vote&ndash;&ndash;hold up your hands.
Come, don&rsquo;t hang back, or you won&rsquo;t get Judas! There
are no priests here, and no spies for priests, and there
have been words enough. Show your hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit looked back into the darkest corner, wondering
what the vote of Jocasta would be; her mother was said
to be Indian, or half Indian, and her hatred of the German
would help her understand these darker tribal sisters.</p>
<p>But in the many lifted hands her own could not be seen
and he felt curiously relieved, though it was no affair
of his, and one vote either way would weigh nothing.</p>
<p>Rotil looked at the lifted hands, and grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win, <i>muchacha</i>,&rdquo; he said to Tula. &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;re the devil, and it&rsquo;s you made the women talk. You
can come along to Soledad and fetch their Judas back to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks to you, and my service, Excellency,&rdquo; said
Tula. &ldquo;I will go and be glad that I go for that. But I
swear by the Body and Blood, and I swear on this,
that I only pay the debt of my people to El Aleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was helping old Tia Tomasa to her feet with one
hand, and held up the little crucifix to him with the other.
She had noted that white people make oath on a cross
when they want to be believed, and she wished with all
her pagan heart to be believed by this man who had
been a sort of legendary hero to her many months before
she had seen his face, or dared hope he would ever grant
favor to her&ndash;&ndash;Tula!</p>
<p>But whatever effect she hoped to secure by emphasizing
her oath on the Christian symbol, she was not prepared
for the rough grasp on her arm, or the harsh command
of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy God!&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;why do you thrust that
in my face,&ndash;&ndash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Tula, but he shook her
as a cat would shake a mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me! How comes it in your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it, se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;and did no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A note of warning flashed from some wireless across
the girl&rsquo;s mind, for it was no little thing by which Ramon
Rotil had suddenly become a growling tiger with his
hand near her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a trail, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the place where the Soledad trail leaves that of
Mesa Blanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil stared at her, and then turned to Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, General, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said honestly enough, &ldquo;but
these women have many such&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; contradicted Rotil, &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t,&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s a
difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had seized the crucifix and held it, while he scanned
the faces, and then brought his gaze back to Tula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will show me that place, and prove yourself,
<i>muchacha</i>,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something&ndash;&ndash;something&ndash;&ndash;Do
you know, you damned young crane,
that I can have my men shoot you against the wall out
there if you lie to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my General, but it is better to give lead to
enemies&ndash;&ndash;and not friends. Also a knife is cheaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! or you may get both!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Here,
look well&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;all of you! Have any of you but this
creature seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held it out, and Valencia, who was nearest, caught
sight of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ai! Tula!&rdquo; she said in reproof, &ldquo;you to take that
when the poor&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula flashed one killing look at her, and Valencia
stopped dead, and turned an ashen gray, and Rotil
watching!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;ha! I thought it!&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;Now whose
trick is it to make me a fool? Come, sift this thing!
You,&rdquo; to Valencia, &ldquo;have looked on this before. Whose
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said with a sort of growl in the voice, &ldquo;something
chokes you? Look at me, not at the others! Also
listen:&ndash;&ndash;if a lie is told to me, every liar here will go before
a firing squad. Whose is this crucifix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valencia&rsquo;s eyes looked sorrow on Tula, still under his
hand, and then on the wood and silver thing held up before
her. The sun was just rolling hot and red above
the mountains, and Rotil&rsquo;s shaggy head was outlined in a
sort of curious radiance as the light struck the white
wall across the patio at his back. Even the silver of the
crucifix caught a glimmer of it, and to Valencia he
looked like the warrior padres of whom her grandmother
used to tell, who would thunder hell&rsquo;s terrors on the
frightened neophytes until the bravest would grovel in
the dust and do penances unbelievable.</p>
<p>That commanding picture came between her and
Rotil,&ndash;&ndash;the outlaw and soldier and patriot. She stumbled
forward with a pleading gesture towards Tula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency, the child does no harm. She is a stranger
in the house. She has picked it up perhaps when lost by
the se&ntilde;ora, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She who is most sorrowful guest here, Excellency,
and her arms still bruised from the iron chains of El
Aleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency, it is the woman saved from your man
by the Americano se&ntilde;or here beside you. And,&ndash;&ndash;she
asked to be nameless while sheltered at Mesa Blanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to me! So this is a game between you
two&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and he looked from Tula to Kit with sinister
threat in his eyes, &ldquo;it is then <i>your</i> woman who&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon&ndash;&ndash;no!&rdquo; said a voice from the far shadows,
and the black shawled figure stood erect and cast off the
muffling disguise. Her pale face shone like a star above
all the kneeling Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God of heaven!&rdquo; he muttered, and his hand fell from
the shoulder of Tula. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;<i>you</i> are one of the women
who knelt here for vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For justice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I was here for a reason
different;&ndash;&ndash;it was a place to hide. No one helped me, let
the child go! Give these women what they ask or deny
them, but send them away. To them I am nameless and
unknown. You can see that even my presence is a thing
of fear to them,&ndash;&ndash;let them go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at her across those frightened dark faces. It
was true they drew away from her in terror; her sudden
uprising was as if she had materialized from the cold
tiles of the chapel floor. Kit noted that their startled
eyes were wide with awe, and knew that they also felt
they were gazing on a beauty akin to that of the pictured
saints. Even the glimmer of the candle touching her
perfect cheek and brow added to the unearthly appearance
there in the shadows.</p>
<p>But Ramon Rotil gazed at her across a wider space
than that marked by the kneeling Indian women! Four
years were bridged by that look, and where the others saw
a pale Madonna, he saw a barefooted child weaving
flowers of the mountain for a shrine where poverty prevented
a candle.</p>
<p>He had sold maize to buy candles, and shoes for her
feet, and she had given him the little brown wooden
crucifix.</p>
<p>Once in the height of her reign of beauty in the
hacienda of Perez, a ragged brown boy from the hills
had lain in wait for her under the oleanders, and thrust
a tightly bound package of corn husks into her hand, and
her maid regarded with amazement the broken fragments
of a wooden cross so poor and cheap that even the most
poverty stricken of the peons could own one, and her
wonder was great that her mistress wept over the broken
pieces and strove to fit them together again.</p>
<p>And now it lay in his hand, bound and framed in silver
wires delicately wrought.</p>
<p>He had traveled farther than she during the years between,
and the memento of the past made him know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon, let them go!&rdquo; she repeated with gentle appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, taking a deep breath as if rousing from
a trance, &ldquo;that is best. Child&ndash;&ndash;see to it, and have your
way. Se&ntilde;or, will you arrange that the se&ntilde;ora has what
comfort there is here? Our horses wait, and work
waits&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw Valencia go with protecting, outstretched
hands to Jocasta, and turned away.</p>
<p>Jocasta never moved. To save her friends from his
rage she had spoken, and to her the big moment of
humiliation dreamed of and feared had come and been
lived through. He had seen her on her knees among
all that brown herd made up of such women as his mother
and her mother had been. From mistress of a palace on
an estate large as many European kingdoms she had become
an outcast with marks of fetters on her arms, while
he was knelt to as a god by the simple people of the
ranges, and held power of life and death over a wide
land!</p>
<p>Kit could not even guess at all the tempestuous background
of the drama enacted there in the chill of the
chapel at sunrise, but the clash of those two outlaw souls
suddenly on guard before each other, thrilled him by the
unexpected. Rotil, profane, ruthless, and jeering, had
suddenly grown still before the face of a woman from
whom he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late! An hour late!&rdquo; he grumbled, hobbling back to
the plaza. &ldquo;What did I tell you? Hell of women!
Well, your damned little crane got what she started after&ndash;&ndash;huh!
Why did she lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, General,&rdquo; said Kit doubtfully, &ldquo;that
the enmity between you and Jos&eacute; Perez is no secret. Even
the children talk of it, and wish success to you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve
heard that one do it! Do&ntilde;a Jocasta is of a Perez household,
so it was supposed you would make prisoner
anyone of their group. And Tula&ndash;&ndash;well, I reckon Tula
listened last night to some rather hard things the se&ntilde;ora
has lived through at Soledad, and knew she would rather
die here than go back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit realized he was on delicate ground when trying
to explain any of the actions of any of the black and
tan group to each other, but he sought the safest way out,
and drew a breath of relief at his success, for Rotil listened
closely, nodding assent, yet frowning in some perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! what does that mean,&ndash;&ndash;rather die than go
back?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;No one has told me why the
lady has come to Mesa Blanca, or what she is doing
here. I don&rsquo;t see&ndash;&ndash;What the devil ails you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Kit stared at him incredulous, and whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got it <i>yet</i>?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Last night you
joked about a girl Marto stole, and we stole from him
again. Don&rsquo;t you realize now who that girl is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jocasta!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time he had uttered her name and there
was a low terrible note in his voice, half choked by
smothered rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could Marto,&ndash;&ndash;or why should&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began
and then halted, checked by various conflicting facts, and
stared frowningly at Rhodes who again strove to explain
that of which he had little knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General, I reckon Marto was square to your interests
about everything but the woman Perez and Conrad sent
north into the desert, and it was Marto&rsquo;s job to see that
she never left it alive. Evidently he did not report that
extra task to you, for he meant to save the woman for
himself. But even at that, General, you&rsquo;ve got to give
him credit. He says she bewitched him, and he couldn&rsquo;t
kill her, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let the others have her. Also
he risked a whale of a beating up, and some lead souvenirs,
in trying to save her, even if it was for himself.
So you see, Marto was only extra human, and is a good
man. His heart&rsquo;s about broke to think he failed you, and
I&rsquo;ll bet he wouldn&rsquo;t fail you again in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have the right of that,&rdquo; agreed Rotil. &ldquo;I
did not know; I don&rsquo;t know yet what this means about
Perez and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us do, General,&rdquo; stated Kit. &ldquo;I heard
Valencia say it must be something only a confessor could
know,&ndash;&ndash;but it must be rather awful at that! She was
started north like an insane criminal, hidden and in chains.
She explains nothing, but General, you have now the two
men at Soledad who made the plan, and you have here
Marto who was their tool&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps&ndash;&ndash;at Soledad&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
he paused questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! that is what will be done,&rdquo; decided Rotil. &ldquo;See
to it, you, after we are gone. Bring Do&ntilde;a Jocasta to
Soledad with as much show of respect as can be mustered
in a poor land, your girl and Isidro&rsquo;s wife to go
along, and any comforts you can find. Yes, that is the
best! Some way we will get to the bottom of this well.
She must know a lot if they did not dare let her live, and
Marto&ndash;&ndash;well, you make a good talk for him, straight
too&ndash;&ndash;Marto will go with me. Tell no one anything.
Make your own plans. By sunset I will have time for
this mystery of the chains of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. Be there at
Soledad by sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your command, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Chappo and Fidelio helped their leader into the
saddle. Marto, crestfallen and silently anticipating the
worst, was led out next; a <i>reata</i> passed around the saddle
horn and circling his waist was fastened back of the
saddle. His hands were free to guide his horse, but
Chappo, with a wicked looking gun and three full cartridge
belts, rode a few paces back of him to see that he
made no forbidden use of them.</p>
<p>Kit watched them ride east while the long line of
women of Palomitas took up the trail over the mesa to
the north. Their high notes of a song came back to
him,&ndash;&ndash;one of those wailing chants of a score of verses
dear to the Mexican heart. In any other place he would
have deemed it a funeral dirge with variations, but with
Indian women at sunrise it meant tuneful content.</p>
<p>Kit listened with a shiver. Because of his own vagrant
airs they had called him &ldquo;El Pajarito&rdquo; when he first
drifted south over Mexican trails,&ndash;&ndash;but happy erratic
tunefulness was smothered for him temporarily. Over
the vast land of riches, smiling in the sun, there brooded
the threats of Indian gods chained, inarticulate, reaching
out in unexpected ways for expression through the dusky
devotees at hidden shrines. The fact that occasionally
they found expression through some perverted fragment
from an imported cult was a gruesome joke on the importers.
But under the eagle of Mexico, whose wide
wings were used as shield by the German vultures across
seas, jokes were not popular. German educators and
foreign priests with Austrian affiliations, saw to that.
The spiritual harvest in Mexico was not always what the
planters anticipated,&ndash;&ndash;for curious crops sprung up in
wild corners of the land, as Indian grains wrapped in a
mummy&rsquo;s robe spring to life under methods of alien culturists.</p>
<p>Vague drifting thoughts like this followed Kit&rsquo;s shiver
of repulsion at that Indian joy song over the promise of a
veritable live Judas. On him they could wreak a personal
vengeance, and go honestly to confession in some
future day, with the conviction that they had, by the
sufferings they could individually and collectively invent
for Judas, in some vague but laudable manner mitigated
the sufferings of a white god far away whose tribulations
were dwelt upon much by the foreign priesthood.</p>
<p>He sensed this without analysis, for his was not the
analytical mind. What brain Kit had was fairly well occupied
by the fact that his own devoted partner was the
moving spirit of that damnable pagan <i>Come, all ye</i>&ndash;&ndash;drifting
back to him from the glorified mesa, flushed
golden now by the full sun.</p>
<p>Clodomiro came wearily up from the corral. The boy
had gone without sleep or rest until his eyes were heavy
and his movements listless. Like the women of Palomitas
he also had worked overtime at the call of Tula, and Kit
wondered at the concerted activity&ndash;&ndash;no one had held
back or blundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clodomiro,&rdquo; he said passing the lad a cigarette and
rolling one for himself from good new tobacco secured
from Fidelio, &ldquo;how comes it that even the women of
years come in the night for prayers when you ride for
them? Do they give heed to any boy who calls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clodomiro gave thanks for the cigarette, but was too
well bred to light it in the presence of an elder or a
superior. He smelled it with pleasure, thrust it over his
ear and regarded Rhodes with perfectly friendly and
apparently sleepy black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always, se&ntilde;or, but when Tula sends the call of
Miguel, all are surely coming, and also making the
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The call of Miguel? Why&ndash;&ndash;Miguel is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, se&ntilde;or, but he was head man, and he had
words of power, also the old Indians listened. Now Tula
has the words, and as you see,&ndash;&ndash;the words are still alive!
I am not knowing what they mean,&ndash;&ndash;the words,&ndash;&ndash;but
when Tula tells me, I take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O Tippecanoe, and Tyler too!</i>&rdquo; hummed Kit studying
the boy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a word? Do you mean that
you take a trail to carry words you don&rsquo;t understand,
because a girl younger than you tells you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, it is my work when it is words of old
prayer, and Tula is sending them. It would be bad not to
go, a quicksand would surely catch my horse, or I might
die from the bite of a <i>sorrilla rabioso</i>, or evil ghosts
might lure me into wide <i>medanos</i> where I would seek
trails forever, and find only my own! Words can do
that on a man! and Tula has the words now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! That&rsquo;s a comfortable chum to have around&ndash;&ndash;not!
And have you no fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much. I am very good,&rdquo; stated Clodomiro
virtuously. &ldquo;Some day maybe I take her for my woman;&ndash;&ndash;her
clan talks about it now. She has almost
enough age, and&ndash;&ndash;you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He directed the attention of Rhodes to the strips of red
and green and pink calico banding his arms, their fluttering
ends very decorative when he moved swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve been admiring them. Very pretty,&rdquo;
said Kit amicably, not knowing the significance of it, but
conscious of the wide range one might cover in a few
minutes of simple Sonora ranch life. From the tragic
and weird to the childishly inane was but a step.</p>
<p>Clodomiro passed on to the kitchen, and Kit smoked his
cigarette and paced the outer corridor, striving for plans
to move forward with his own interests, and employ the
same time and the same trail for the task set by Ramon
Rotil.</p>
<p>Rotil had stated that the escort of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta must
be as complete as could be arranged. This meant a due&ntilde;a
and a maid at least, and as he had bidden Tula have her
way with her &ldquo;Judas,&rdquo; it surely meant that Tula must
go to Soledad. Very well so far, and as Rotil would
certainly not question the extent of the outfit taken along,
why not include any trifles Tula and he chanced to care
for? He remembered also that there were some scattered
belongings of the Whitely&rsquo;s left behind in the haste
of departure. Well, a few mule loads would be a neighborly
gift to take north when he crossed the border, and
Soledad was nearer the border!</p>
<p>It arranged itself very well indeed, and as Tula emerged
from the patio smoothing out an old newspaper fragment
discarded by Fidelio, and chewing <i>chica</i> given her
by Clodomiro, he hailed her with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Indian Angel,&rdquo; he remarked appreciatively,
&ldquo;you greased the toboggan for several kinds of hell for
us this day of our salvation, but your jinx was on the
job, and turned the trick our way! Do you know you are
the greatest little mascot ever held in captivity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tula didn&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;mascot&rdquo; meant, and was
very much occupied with the advertisement of a suit and
cloak house in the old Nogales paper in which some trader
at the railroad had wrapped Fidelio&rsquo;s tobacco. It had
the picture of an alluring lady in a dress of much material
slipping from the shoulders and dragging around
the feet. To the aboriginal mind that seemed a very great
waste, for woven material was hard to come by in the
desert.</p>
<p>She attempted an inquiry concerning that wastefulness
of Americanas, but got no satisfactory reply. Kit took
the tattered old paper from her hand, and turned it over
because of the face of Singleton staring at him from
the other side of the page. It was the account of the
inquest, and in the endeavor to add interest the local reporters
had written up a column concerning Singleton&rsquo;s
quarrel with the range boss, Rhodes,&ndash;&ndash;and the mysterious
disappearance of the latter across the border!</p>
<p>There was sympathetic mention made of Miss Wilfreda
Bernard, heiress of Granados, and appreciative mention
of the efficient manager, Conrad, who had offered all
possible assistance to the authorities in the sad affair.
The general expression of the article was regret that the
present situation along the border prevented further investigation
concerning Rhodes. The said Rhodes appeared
to be a stranger in the locality, and had been
engaged by the victim of the crime despite the objections
of Manager Conrad.</p>
<p>There followed the usual praise and list of virtues of
the dead man, together with reference to the illustrious
Spanish pioneer family from whom his wife had been
descended. It was the first time Kit had been aware of
the importance of Billie&rsquo;s genealogy, and remembering
the generally accepted estimates of Spanish pride, he muttered
something about a &ldquo;rose leaf princess, and a
Tennessee hill-billy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some jolt, two of them!&rdquo; he conceded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE SECRET OF SOLEDAD CHAPEL</h3>
</div>
<p>It took considerable persuasion to prevail upon Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta that a return to Soledad would be of any advantage
to anybody. To her it was a place fearful and
accursed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;ora, a padre who sought to be of service to
you is still there, a prisoner. In the warring of those
wild men who will speak for him? The men of Soledad
would have killed him but for their superstitions, and
Rotil is notorious for his dislike of priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she murmured sadly. &ldquo;There are some
good ones, but he will never believe. In his scales the bad
ones weigh them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one at Soledad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, se&ntilde;or, he spoke for me,&ndash;&ndash;Padre Andreas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a prisoner because of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. You do well to remind me of that.
My own sorrows sink me in selfishness, and it is a
good friend who shows me my duty. Yes, we will go.
God only knows what is in the heart of Ramon Rotil that
he wishes it, but that which he says is law today wherever
his men ride, and I want no more sorrow in the
world because of me. We will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valencia had gone placidly about preparations for the
journey from the moment Kit had expressed the will of
the Deliverer. To hesitate when he spoke seemed a foolish
thing, for in the end he always did the thing he willed,
and to form part of the escort for Do&ntilde;a Jocasta filled
her with pride. She approved promptly the suggestion
that certain bed and table furnishings go to Soledad for
use of the se&ntilde;ora, and later be carried north to Mrs.
Whitely, whose property they were.</p>
<p>As capitan of the outfit, Kit bade her lay out all such
additions to their state and comfort, and he would personally
make all packs and decide what animals, chests,
or provisions could be taken.</p>
<p>This was easier managed than he dared hope. Clodomiro
rode after mules and returned with Benito and
Mariano at his heels, both joyously content to leave the
planting of fields and offer their young lives to the army
of the Deliverer. Isidro was busy with the duties of the
ranch stock, and there was only Tula to see bags of
nuggets distributed where they would be least noticed
among the linen, Indian rugs, baskets and such family
possessions easiest carried to their owner.</p>
<p>He marked the packs to be opened, and Tula, watching,
did not need to be told.</p>
<p>The emotions of the night and the uncertainty of what
lay ahead left Rhodes and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta rather silent
as they took the trail to the gruesome old hacienda called
by Do&ntilde;a Jocasta so fearful and accursed. Many miles
went by with only an occasional word of warning between
them where the way was bad, or a word of command
for the animals following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the night I rode without fear where I dare not
look in the sunlight,&rdquo; said Jocasta drawing back from a
narrow ledge where stones slipped under the hoofs of
the horses to fall a hundred feet below in a dry ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;ora, the night was kind to all of us,&rdquo; returned
Kit politely. &ldquo;Even the accidents worked for
good except for the pain to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is but little, and my shoulder of no use to anyone.
General Rotil is very different,&ndash;&ndash;a wound to a
soldier means loss of time. It is well that shot found him
among friends for it is said that when a wolf has wounds
the pack unites to tear him to pieces, and there are
many,&ndash;&ndash;many pesos offered to the traitor who will trap
Rotil by any lucky accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he took no special care at Mesa Blanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? He brought with him only men of the
district as guard. Be sure they knew every hidden trail,
and every family. Ramon Rotil is a coyote for the knowing
of traps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke as all Altar spoke, with a certain pride in
the ability of the man she had known as a burro driver
of the sierras. For three years he had been an outlaw
with a price on his head, and as a rebel general the price
had doubled many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With so many poor, how comes it that no informer
has been found? The reward would be riches untold
to a poor <i>paisano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be to his widow,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, &ldquo;but
no sons of his, and no brothers would be left alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. I reckon the friends of Rotil would see to
that! Faithful hearts are the ones he picks for comrades.
I heard an old-timer say the Deliverer has that gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him quickly, and away again, and went
silent. He wondered if it was true that there had been
love between these two, and she had been unfaithful.
Love and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta were fruitful themes for the
imagination of any man.</p>
<p>Valencia was having the great adventure of her life
in her journey to Soledad, and she chattered to Tula as a
maiden going to a marriage. Three people illustrious
in her small world were at once to be centered on the
stage of war before her eyes. She told Tula it was a
thing to make songs of,&ndash;&ndash;the two men and the most
beautiful woman!</p>
<p>When they emerged from the ca&ntilde;on into the wide
spreading plain, with the sierras looming high and blue
beyond, the eyes of Kit and Tula met, and then turned
toward their own little camp in the lap of the mother
range. All was flat blue against the sky there, and no
indications of ca&ntilde;on or gulch or pocket discernible. Even
as they drew nearer to the hacienda, and Kit surreptitiously
used the precious field glasses, thus far concealed
from all new friends of the desert, he found difficulty in
locating their hill of the treasure, and realized that their
fears of discovery in the little ca&ntilde;on had been groundless.
In the far-away time when the giant aliso had flourished
there by the ca&ntilde;on stream, its height might have served
to mark the special ravine where it grew, but the lightning
sent by pagan gods had annihilated that landmark forever,
and there was no other.</p>
<p>The glint of tears shone in the eyes of Tula, and she
rode with downcast eyes, crooning a vagrant Indian air
in which there were bird calls, and a whimpering long-drawn
tremulo of a baby coyote caught in a trap, a weird
ungodly improvisation to hear even with the shining sun
warming the world.</p>
<p>Kit concluded she was sending her brand of harmony
to Miguel and the ghosts on guard over the hidden
trail.&ndash;&ndash;And he rather wished she would stop it!</p>
<p>Even the chatter of Valencia grew silent under the spell
of the girl&rsquo;s gruesome intonings,&ndash;&ndash;ill music for her entrance
to a new portal of adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds of death,&rdquo; murmured Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, and
made the sign of the cross. &ldquo;The saints send that the
soul to go next has made peace with God! See, se&ntilde;or,
we are truly crossing a place of death as she sings. That
beautiful valley of the green border is the <i>sumidero</i>,&ndash;&ndash;the
quicksands from hidden springs somewhere above,&rdquo;
and she pointed to the blue sierras. &ldquo;I think that is the
grave Jos&eacute; meant for me at Soledad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice cheerful end of the trail&ndash;&ndash;not!&rdquo; gloomed Kit
strictly to himself. &ldquo;That little imp is whining of trouble
like some be-deviled prophetess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards he remembered that thought, and wished
he could forget!</p>
<p>Blue shadows stretched eastward across the wide zacatan
meadows, and the hacienda on the far mesa, with its
white and cream adobe walls, shone opal-like in the
lavender haze of the setting sun.</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes had timed the trip well and according to
instruction of the general, but was a bit surprised to find
that his little cavalcade was merely part of a more elaborate
plan arranged for sunset at Soledad.</p>
<p>A double line of horsemen rode out from the hacienda
to meet them, a rather formidable reception committee
as they filed in soldier-like formation over the three miles
of yellow and green of the spring growths, and halted
where the glint of water shone in a dam filled from wells
above.</p>
<p>Their officer saluted and rode forward, his hat in his
hand as he bowed before Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Rotil presents to you his compliments,
Se&ntilde;ora Perez, and sends his guard as a mark of respect
when you are pleased to ride once more across your own
lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks are without words, se&ntilde;or. I appreciate
the honor shown to me. My generalissimo will answer
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She indicated Kit with a wan smile, and her moment
of hesitation over, his title reminded him that no name
but El Pajarito had been given him by his Indian friends.
That, and the office of manager of Mesa Blanca, was all
that served as his introduction to her, and to Rotil. With
the old newspaper in his pocket indicating that Kit
Rhodes was the only name connected with the murder at
Granados, he concluded it was just as well.</p>
<p>The guard drew to either side, and the officer and Kit,
with Do&ntilde;a Jocasta between them, rode between the two
lines, followed by Tula and Valencia. Then the guard
fell in back of them, leaving Clodomiro with the pack
animals and the Indian boys to follow after in the dust.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta was pale, and her eyes sought Kit&rsquo;s in
troubled question, but she held her head very erect, and
the shrouding lace veil hid all but her eyes from the
strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Pajarito,&rdquo; she murmured doubtfully. &ldquo;The
sun is still shining, and there are no chains on my
wrists,&ndash;&ndash;otherwise this guard gives much likeness to
my first arrival at the hacienda of Soledad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a strong belief that no harm is meant to you
by the general commanding,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;else I would
have sought another trail, and these men look friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God send they be so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have all the earmarks,&ndash;&ndash;and look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were near enough the hacienda to see men
emerge from the portal, and one who limped and leaned
on a cane, moved ahead of the others and stood waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an honor that I may bid you welcome to your
own estate, Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;We have
only fare of soldiers to offer you at first, but a few days
and good couriers can remedy that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you accept my thanks, <i>Commandante</i>,&rdquo; she
murmured lowly. &ldquo;The trail was not of my choosing,
and it is an ill time for women to come journeying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time is a good time,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;for there
is a limit to my hours here. And in one of them I may
do service for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His men stood at either side watching. There were
wild tales told of Ramon Rotil and women who crossed
or followed his trail, but here was the most beautiful of
all women riding to his door and he gave her no smile,&ndash;&ndash;merely
motioned to the Americano that he assist her from
the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supper is ready, and your woman and the priest
will see that care is given for your comfort,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Afterwards, in the <i>sala</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent her head, and with Kit beside her passed on
to the inner portal. There a dark priest met her and
reached out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No welcome is due me, Padre Andreas,&rdquo; she said
brokenly. &ldquo;I turned coward and tried to save myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; he returned with a wry smile at Kit, and
a touch of cynic humor, &ldquo;you had right in going. The
lieutenant would have had no pleasure in adding me to
his elopement, and, as we hear,&ndash;&ndash;your stolen trail carried
you to good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit left them there and gave his attention to space for
the packs and outfit, but learned that the general had
allotted to him the small corral used in happier days for
the saddle horses of the family. There was a gate to
it and a lock to the gate. Chappo had been given charge,
and when all was safely bestowed, he gave the key to
the American.</p>
<p>The brief twilight crept over the world, and candles
were lit when Kit returned to the corridor. Rotil was
seated, giving orders to men who rode in and dismounted,
and others who came out from supper, mounted and rode
away. It was the guard from a wide-flung arc bringing
report of sentinels stationed at every pass and water hole.</p>
<p>Padre Andreas was there presenting some appeal, and
to judge by his manner he was not hopeful of success.
Yet spoke as a duty of his office and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your office to me?&rdquo; asked Rotil coldly. &ldquo;Do
your duty and confess him when the time comes if that is
his wish. It is more than he would have given to her or
the foreman who stored the ammunition. Him he had
killed as the German had Miguel Herrara killed on the
border,&ndash;&ndash;and Herrara had been faithful to that gun running
for months. When man or woman is faithful to
Jos&eacute; Perez long enough to learn secrets, he rewards them
with death. A dose of his own brew will be fit medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woman,&ndash;&ndash;she is safe. She is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very safe!&rdquo; agreed Rotil, sneering. &ldquo;Shall I
tell you, pious Father, how safe she is? The cholo who
took food to Perez and that German dog has brought me a
message. See, it is on paper, and is clear for any to read.
You&ndash;&ndash;no not you, but Don Pajarito here shall read it.
He is a neutral, and not a padre scheming to save the soul
of a man who never had a soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit held it to the light, read it, and returned it to
Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, General. He offers her to you
in exchange for his own freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to pay for that writing I had him chained
where he could see her enter the plaza as a queen, if we
had queens in Mexico! You had an unseen audience for
your arrival. The guard reports that the German friend
of Perez seems to love you, Don Pajarito, very much
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he does. Here is the mark of one of his little
love pats with a monkey wrench,&rdquo; and Kit parted his hair
to show the scar of the Granados assault. &ldquo;I got that for
interfering when he was trying to kill his employer&rsquo;s
herds with ground glass in their feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? no wonder if he goes in a rage to see you riding
as a lady&rsquo;s caballero while he feels the weight of chains
in a prison. This world is but a little place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Padre Andreas, regarding Kit,
for the story of the horses was told to me by Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta here in Soledad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; demanded Rotil. &ldquo;Is it not
true you met the lady first at Mesa Blanca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; said Kit, alert at the note of suspicion,
&ldquo;if the lady knows aught of Granados, it is a mystery to
me, and is of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much a mystery,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Conrad
boasted much when glasses were emptied with Perez
on the Hermosillo rancho, and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta heard. He
told the number of cavalry horses killed by his men, also
the owner of that ranch of Granados who had to be
silenced for the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for those kind words, Padre,&rdquo; said Kit. &ldquo;If
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta has a clear memory of that boasting, she
may save a life for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Rotil speculatively. &ldquo;We seem finding
new trails at Soledad. Whose life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The partner of a chum of mine,&rdquo; stated Kit lightly,
as he did some quick thinking concerning the complications
likely to arise if he was regarded as a possible
murderer hiding from the law. &ldquo;My own hunch is that
Conrad himself did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of a trap for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no, General, unless he was led to believe that I was
under guard here. He might express his sentiments more
freely if he thought I would never get back across the
border alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! This offer from Perez is to go into
the keeping of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. You&rsquo;ve the duty of taking
it to her. We have not yet found that ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did cross the border, and somebody got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says it was moved to Hermosillo before Juan
Gonsalvo, the overseer, died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was shot, you mean, after it was cached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but he offers to trade part of it for his
liberty, and deliver the goods north of Querobabi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, General,&ndash;&ndash;into the bodies of your men if you
trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil chuckled. &ldquo;You are not so young as you look,
Don Pajarito, and need no warning. It is the room next
the <i>sala</i> where I will have Perez and Conrad brought.
The se&ntilde;ora can easily overhear what is said. It may be
she will have the mind to help when she sees that offer
he made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so, yet&ndash;&ndash;women are strange! They
go like the padre, to prayers when a life is at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some women, and some priests, boy,&rdquo; said the dark
priest. &ldquo;It may be that you do not know Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark appeared to amuse Rotil, for he smiled
grimly and with a gesture indicated that they were to
join Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.</p>
<p>She was rested and refreshed by a good supper.
Valencia and Elena, the cook, had waited upon her and
the latter waxed eloquent over the stupendous changes
at Soledad from the time of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta&rsquo;s supper the
previous day. Many of the angry men had been ready
to start after Marto who had cheated them, when a
courier rode in with the word that Don Jos&eacute; and Se&ntilde;or
Conrad were close behind. Then the surprise of all when
Don Jos&eacute; was captured, and it was seen that Elena had
been cooking these many days, not for simple vaqueros,
but for some soldiers of the revolution by which peace
and plenty was to come to all the land! It was a beautiful
dream, and the Deliverer was to make it come true!</p>
<p>Tula sat in the shadow against the wall, like some
slender Indian carving, mute and expressionless while
the eyes of the woman rolled as the two old friends exchanged
their wonder tales of the night and day! Elena
made definite engagement to be with the &ldquo;Judas&rdquo; trailers
on the dark Friday, and both breathed blessings on
Rotil who had promised them the right man for the
hanging.</p>
<p>It was this cheerful topic Kit entered upon with the
written note from Perez to the general. He had no liking
for his task, as his eyes rested on Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,
beautiful, resigned and detached from the scene about
her. He remembered what Rotil had said scoffingly of
saints lifted from shrines&ndash;&ndash;a man never forgot that
shrine was empty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is a thankless task, se&ntilde;ora, but the general
decided you are the best keeper of this,&rdquo; and he gave to
her the scribbled page torn from a note book.</p>
<p>She took it and held it unread, looking at him with
dark tragic eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have fear of written words, se&ntilde;or, and would rather
hear them spoken. So many changes have come that I
dread new changes. No matter where my cage is moved,
it is still a cage to me,&rdquo; she said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a hunch, Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, that the bars of that cage
are going to be broken for you,&rdquo; ventured Kit, taking the
seat she indicated, &ldquo;and this note may be one of the
weapons to do it. Evidently Se&ntilde;or Perez has had some
mistaken information concerning the stealing of you from
here;&ndash;&ndash;he thought it was by the general&rsquo;s order. So
mistaken was he that he thought you were the object of
Rotil&rsquo;s raid on Soledad, and for his own freedom he
has offered to give you, and half his stock of ammunition,
to General Ramon Rotil, and agree to a truce between
their factions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! he offers to make gift of me to the man he
hates,&rdquo; she said after a long silence. &ldquo;And the guns and
ammunition,&ndash;&ndash;he also surrenders them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He offers&ndash;&ndash;but it is written here! Since the guns,
however, have been taken south, he cannot give them;
he can only promise them, until such time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; she said scornfully. &ldquo;Is that the tale he tells?
It is true there are guns in the south, but guns are also
elsewhere! He forgets, does Jos&eacute; Perez,&ndash;&ndash;or else he
plays for time. This offer,&rdquo; and she referred to the note,
&ldquo;it is not written since we arrived&ndash;&ndash;no. It was written
earlier, when he thought I was held by that renegade
far in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that is true, se&ntilde;ora, for after receiving it,
Rotil had him chained in a room fronting the plaza that
he might see you enter Soledad with honors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon Rotil did that?&rdquo; she mused, looking at the
note thoughtfully, &ldquo;and he gives to me the evidence
against Jos&eacute;? Se&ntilde;or, in the Perez lands we hear only
evil things and very different things about Rotil. They
would say this paper was for sale, but not for a gift.
And&ndash;&ndash;he gives it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit also remembered different things and evil things
told of Rotil, but they were not for discussion with a lady.
He had wondered a bit that it was not the padre who
was given the message to transmit, yet suddenly he
realized that even the padre might have tried to make
it a question of barter, for the padre wanted help for his
priestly office in the saving of Perez&rsquo; soul, and incidentally
of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;ora, it seems a free-will offering, and he said
to tell you it would be in the room adjoining this that
Perez would be questioned as to the war material. Rotil&rsquo;s
men have searched, and his officers have questioned, but
Perez evidently thinks Rotil will not execute him, as a
ransom will pay much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, death pays no one&ndash;&ndash;no one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was weighted with sadness, and Kit wondered
what the cloud was under which she lived. The
padre evidently knew, but none of Rotil&rsquo;s men. It could
not be the mere irregularity of her life with Perez, for
to the peon mind she was the great lady of a great
hacienda, and wife of the padrone. No,&ndash;&ndash;he realized
that the sin of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta had been a different thing,
and that the shadow of it enveloped her as a dark cloak
of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, se&ntilde;ora, that death pays no one, except that
the death of one man may save other lives more valuable.
That often happens,&rdquo; remarked Kit, with the idea of distracting
her from her own woe, whatever it was. &ldquo;It
might have seemed a crime if one of his nurses had
chucked a double dose of laudanum into Bill Hohenzollern&rsquo;s
baby feed, but that nurse would have saved the
lives of hundreds of thousands of innocents, so you never
can tell whether a murderer is a devil, or a man doing
work of the angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill?&rdquo; Evidently the name was a new one to Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name of the Prussian pirate of the Huns
across the water. Your friend Conrad belongs to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend! My <i>friend</i>, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
was on her feet, white and furious, her eyes flaming
hatred. Kit Rhodes was appalled at the spirit he had
carelessly wakened. He remembered the statement of
the priest that he evidently did not know the lady well,
and realized in a flash that he certainly did not, also that
he would feel more comfortable elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, I beg a thousand pardons for my foolishness,&rdquo;
he implored. &ldquo;My&ndash;&ndash;my faulty Spanish caused
me to speak the wrong word. Will you not forgive me
such a stupid blunder? Everyone knows the German
brute could not be a friend of yours, and that you could
have only hatred of his kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She regarded him steadily with the ever ready suspicion
against an Americano showing in her eyes, but his regret
was so evident, and his devotion to her interests so sincere,
that the tension relaxed, and she sank back in her
chair, her hand trembling as she covered her eyes for
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I who am wrong, se&ntilde;or. You cannot know how
the name of that man is a poison, and why absolution
is refused me because I will not forgive,&ndash;&ndash;and will not say
I forgive! I will not lie, and because of the hate of him
my feet will tread the fires of hell. The padre is telling
me that, so what use to pray? Of what use, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit could see no special use if she had accepted the
threat of the priest that hell was her portion anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would not take that gabble of a priest seriously
if I were you,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;No one can beat me in
detesting the German and what he stands for, but I have
no plans of going to hell for it&ndash;&ndash;not on your life! To
hate Conrad, or to kill him would be like killing a rattlesnake,
or stamping a tarantula into the sand. He has
been let live to sting too many, and Padre Andreas tells
me you heard him boast of an American killing at
Granados!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, se&ntilde;or, and it was so clever too! It was
pleasure for him to tell of that because of clever tricks
in it. They climbed poles to the wires and called the
man to a town, then they waited on that road and shot
him before he reached the town. The alcalde of that
place decided the man had killed himself, and Conrad
laughed with Jos&eacute; Perez on account of that, because they
were so clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; queried Kit trying to prevent his eagerness
from showing in his voice. &ldquo;Who helped him? Not
Perez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, in that sin Jos&eacute; had no part. It was
a very important man who did not appear important;&ndash;&ndash;quite
the other way, and like a man of piety. His name,
I am remembering it well, for it is Diego,&ndash;&ndash;but said in
the American way, which is James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diego, said in the American way?&rdquo; repeated Kit
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Is he then an American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, se&ntilde;or! He is Aleman <i>commandante</i> for
the border. His word is an order for life or death,
and Jos&eacute; Perez is of his circle. The guns buried by Perez
are bought with the German money; it is for war of
Sonora against Arizona when that day comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! that day isn&rsquo;t coming unless the Huns put
more of a force down here than is yet in sight,&rdquo; declared
Kit, &ldquo;but that &lsquo;Diego&rsquo; bothers me. I know many
James&rsquo;,&ndash;&ndash;several at Granados, but not the sort you tell
of, se&ntilde;ora. Will you speak of that murder again, and
let it be put on paper for me? I have friends at Granados
who may be troubled about it, and your help would be
as&ndash;&ndash;as the word of an angel at the right hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad angel, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;but why
should I not help you to your wish since you have guarded
me well? It is a little thing you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian women at the far end of the <i>sala</i> had
lowered their voices, but their gossip in murmurs and
expressive gestures flowed on, and only Tula gave heed
to the talk at the table of wars and guns, and secrets of
murder, and that was no new thing in Sonora.</p>
<p>One door of the <i>sala</i> opened from the patio, and another
into a room used as a chapel after the old adobe
walls of the mission church had melted utterly back into
the earth. Rotil had selected it merely because its only
window was very high, an architectural variation caused
by a wing of the mission rooms still standing when
Soledad hacienda was built. A new wall had been built
against the older and lower one which still remained,
with old sleeping cells of the neophytes used as tool sheds,
and an unsightly litter of propped or tumbling walls back
of the ranch house.</p>
<p>The door from the <i>sala</i> was slightly ajar, and the
voice of Fidelio was heard there. He asked someone for
another candle, and another chair. And there was the
movement of feet, and rearrangement of furniture.</p>
<p>Rotil entered the <i>sala</i> from the patio, and stood just
inside, looking about him.</p>
<p>With a brief word and gesture he indicated that Elena
and Valencia vacate. At Tula he glanced, but did not
bid her follow. He noted the folded paper in the hand
of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, but did not address her; it was to Kit
he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door will be left open. I learn that Conrad distrusts
Perez because he paid German money, and shipped
the guns across the border, but Perez never uncovered
one for him. They are badly scared and ready to cut
each other&rsquo;s throats if they had knives. Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
may overhear what she pleases, and furnish the knives
as well if she so decides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Do&ntilde;a Jocasta with a shudder put up her hand in
protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No knife, no knife!&rdquo; she murmured, and Rotil
shrugged his shoulders and looked at Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little crane in the corner would walk barefoot
over embers of hell to get a knife and get at Conrad,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You have taste in your favorites, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to get a certain amusement in the contemplation
of Kit and Tula; he had seen no other American
with quite that sort of addition to his outfit. Kit
was content to let him think his worst, as to tell the truth
would no doubt lose them a friend. It tickled the general&rsquo;s
fancy to think the thin moody Indian girl, immature
and childlike, was an American&rsquo;s idea of a sweetheart!</p>
<p>Voices and the clank of chains were heard in the
patio, and then in the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bring us here when your questions were given
answer as well in another place?&rdquo; demanded a man&rsquo;s
voice, and at that Do&ntilde;a Jocasta looked at Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why do you?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He stared at her, frowning and puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you? I did it that you might hear him
repeat his offer. What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;see,&rdquo; she said, bending her head, but as Rotil
went to the door, Kit noted that the eyes of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
followed him curiously. He concluded that the unseen
man of the voice was Jos&eacute; Perez.</p>
<p>Then the voice of Conrad was heard cursing at a chain
too heavy. Rotil laughed, and walked into the chapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you something, you German Judas!&rdquo; he
said coldly. &ldquo;You will live to see the day when these
chains, and this safe old chapel, will be as a paradise
you once lived in. You will beg to crawl on your knees
to be again comfortably inside this door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that some Mexican joke?&rdquo; asked Conrad, and
Rotil laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is, and it will be on you! They tell me you
collect girls in Sonora for a price. Well, they have grown
fond of you,&ndash;&ndash;the Indian women of Sonora! They say
you must end your days here with them. I have not
heard of a ransom price they would listen to,&ndash;&ndash;though
you might think of what you have to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer?&rdquo; growled Conrad. &ldquo;How is there anything
to offer in Sonora when Perez here has sent the guns
south?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, the matter of ransom seems to rest with Se&ntilde;or
Perez who is saving of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put the words on paper, and sent it by your man,&rdquo;
said Perez. &ldquo;What else is there to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that?&rdquo; returned Rotil. &ldquo;My boys play tricks,
and make jokes with me like happy children. Yes,
Chappo did bring words on paper,&ndash;&ndash;foolish words he
might have written himself. I take no account of such
things. You are asked for the guns, and I get foolish
words on paper of a woman you would trade to me, and
guns you would send me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gives you right to trade the woman, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has a better right? She belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! And her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I like my bargains with witness, and
they must witness the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jocasta&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; There was a slight hesitation, and Rotil
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been known as Se&ntilde;ora Jocasta Perez, is it
not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; came the slow reply, &ldquo;but that was foolishness
of the peons on my estates. They called her that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! One woman called Jocasta Perez is
offered to me in trade with the guns. Jos&eacute; Perez, have
you not seen that the Do&ntilde;a Jocasta Perez is even now
mistress of Soledad, and that my men and I are as her
servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocasta on the other side of the door strangled a half
sob as she heard him, and crept nearer the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are a good one at a bargain, Ramon Rotil!
You try to pretend the woman cannot count in this trade,
but women always count,&ndash;&ndash;women like Jocasta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Then we will certainly take count of the woman&ndash;&ndash;one
woman! Now to guns and ammunition. How
many, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Hermosillo, and it will take a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no week to waste, and I do not mean the
guns at Hermosillo. You have five minutes, Jos&eacute; Perez.
Also those playful boys are building a nice warm fire
for the branding irons. And you will both get a
smell of your own burning hides if I wait longer for an
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy God!&rdquo; shouted Conrad. &ldquo;Why burn me for
his work? From me the guns have been hid as well as
from you;&ndash;&ndash;all I got was promises! They are my
guns,&ndash;&ndash;my money paid, but he is not straight! Here
at Soledad he was to show me this time, but I think now
it was a trick to murder me as he murdered Juan Gonsalvo,
the foreman who stored them away for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animal!&rdquo; growled Perez. &ldquo;You have lost your head
to talk of murders to me! Two murders at Granados are
waiting for you, and it is not far to ship you back to the
border! Walk with care, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are each wasting time with your truth telling,&rdquo;
stated Rotil. &ldquo;This is no time to count your dead men.
It is the count of the guns I want. And a sight of the
ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a guide to Hermosillo, and the price of guns
can be got for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the <i>price</i> of guns I asked you for, it is
guns,&ndash;&ndash;the guns Conrad and Herrara got over the border for
you. Your time is going fast, Jos&eacute; Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not to be had this side of Hermosillo, send
me south if you want them. But it is well to remember
that if an accident happens to me you never could get
them,&ndash;&ndash;never! I alone know their hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that reason have I waited for your visit to Soledad,&ndash;&ndash;you
and your carts and your pack mules,&rdquo; stated
Rotil. &ldquo;Do not forget that Marto Cavayso and other
men of mine have been for weeks with your ranchmen.
Your pack train comes here empty, and means one thing
only&ndash;&ndash;they came for the American guns! Your minutes
are going, se&ntilde;or, and the branding irons are getting heat
from the fire. One more minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write the figures of the ransom, and grant me a messenger
to Hermosillo. You have the whip hand, you
can make your price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But me? What of <i>my</i> ransom?&rdquo; demanded Conrad.
&ldquo;My money, and my time paid for those guns&ndash;&ndash;I have
not seen one of them this side of the border! If no guns
are paid for me, money must be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No price is asked for you. I told you the women
have named no ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women? That is foolishness. It is not women for
whom you hold me! He has turned traitor, has Perez!
He wants me sent back across the border without that
price of the guns for his mushroom government! He has
told his own tales of Herrara, and of Singleton, and they
are lies&ndash;&ndash;all lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the tale of Diego, said in the American
way?&rdquo; asked Kit stepping inside the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diego! Diego!&rdquo; repeated Conrad and made a leap
at Perez. &ldquo;You have sold me out to the Americans, you
scum! James warned me you were scum of the gutters,
and now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard caught him, and he stood there shaking with
fury in the dim light. Perez drew away with a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with you and James and your crew on the
border,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I care nothing as to how soon the
damned gringos swing you both. When you Germans
want to use us we are your &lsquo;dear brothers.&rsquo; When we
out-trick you, we are only scum, eh? You can tell your
<i>commandante</i> James that I won the game from him, and
all the guns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks to you, General Rotil, that I have been
allowed to hear this,&rdquo; said Kit, &ldquo;also that I have witness.
I&rsquo;d do as much for you if the chance comes. Two men
were killed on the border by Conrad under order of this
James. Herrara was murdered in prison for fear he
would turn informer about the guns. Singleton was murdered
to prevent him investigating the German poisoning
of cavalry horses. The German swine meant to control
Granados rancho a few months longer for their own
purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Meant</i> to?&rdquo; sneered Conrad. &ldquo;You raw cub!&ndash;&ndash;you
are playing with dynamite and due for a fall. So is your
fool country! Though Perez here has lost his nerve and
turned traitor to our deal, that is only a little puff of wind
against the bulwarks of the Fatherland! We will hold
Granados; we will hold the border; and with Mexico
(not this crook of the west, but <i>real</i> Mexico) we will win
and hold every border state and every Pacific coast state!
You,&ndash;&ndash;poor fool!&ndash;&ndash;will never reach Granados alive to
tell this. You are but one American in the Indian wilderness,
and you are sure to go under, but you go knowing
that though James and I die, and though a thousand more
of us die, there will be ten thousand secret German
workers in America to carry on our plan until all the
world will be under the power of the Prussian eagle!
You,&ndash;&ndash;who think you know so much, can add <i>that</i> to
finish your education in Sonora, and carry it to hell with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice, coldly contemptuous at first, had risen to a
wrathful shriek as he faced the American and hurled at
him the exultance of the Teuton dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am in great luck to be your one American
confessor,&rdquo; grinned Kit, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll postpone that trip as
long as possible. I reckon General Rotil will let the
padre help me make note of this education you are handing
out to me. A lot of Americans need it! Have I your
permission, General?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; snapped Rotil. &ldquo;They have
used up their time limit in scolding like old women.
Perez, I wait for the guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me to Hermosillo and I will recover enough for
a ransom,&rdquo; said Perez.</p>
<p>Rotil regarded him a moment through half-closed,
sinister eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was your last chance, and you threw it away.
Chappo, strip him; Fidelio, fetch the branding irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez shrank back, staring at Rotil as if fascinated.
He was striving to measure the lengths to which the
&ldquo;Hawk of the Sierras&rdquo; would go, and a sudden gleam of
hope came into his eyes as Padre Andreas held up a crucifix
before Chappo, waving him aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rotil,&ndash;&ndash;torture is a thing for animals, not men!
Hell waits for the sinner who&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell won&rsquo;t wait for you one holy minute!&rdquo; snapped
Rotil. &ldquo;Get back with the women where you belong;
there is men&rsquo;s work to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught the priest by the arm in an iron grip and
whirled him towards the <i>sala</i>. The man would have
fallen but for Kit who caught him, but could not save
the crash of his head against the door. Blood streamed
from a cut in his forehead, and thus he staggered into the
room where Do&ntilde;a Jocasta stood, horror-stricken and
poised for flight.</p>
<p>But the sight of the blood-stained priest, and the sound
of a strange, half animal cry from the other room, turned
her feet that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ramon! No-<i>no</i>!&rdquo; she cried and sped through
the door to fling herself between him and his victims.</p>
<p>Her arms were stretched wide and she halted, almost
touching him, with her back to the chained man towards
whom she had not glanced, but she could not help seeing
the charcoal brazier with the red-hot branding irons held
by Fidelio. The gasping cry had come from Conrad by
whom the brazier was set.</p>
<p>Ramon Rotil stared at her, frowning as if he would
fling her from his path as he had the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ramon!&rdquo; she said again, still with that supplicating
look and gesture, &ldquo;send them out of here,&ndash;&ndash;both
these men. I would smother and die in a room with
that German beast. You will not be sorry, Ramon Rotil,
I promise you that,&ndash;&ndash;I promise you by the God I dare not
face!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;No, Ramon! No!&rdquo; she cried, and flung herself between him and his victims.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; snarled Perez. &ldquo;Is the priest also her lover
that she&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the German out, and let Jos&eacute; Perez stay to see
that I keep my promise,&rdquo; she said letting her arms fall at
her side, but facing Rotil with an addition of hauteur in
her poise and glance. &ldquo;The price he will pay for the
words he has spoken here will be a heavy price,&ndash;&ndash;one he has
risked life to hold! Send that pale snake and your men
outside, Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez was leaning forward, his face strained and white,
watching her. He could not see her face, but the glimpse
of hope came again into his eyes&ndash;&ndash;a woman might succeed
with Rotil where a priest would fail!</p>
<p>Rotil, still frowning at her, waved his hand to Chappo
and Fidelio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and wait beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shuffling movement and clank of chains was heard,
but she did not turn her head. Instead she moved past
Rotil, lifted a candle, and went towards the shrine at
the end of the room.</p>
<p>A table was there with a scarf across it, and back of
the table three steps leading up to a little platform on
which were ranged two or three mediocre statues of
saints, once brilliant with blue and scarlet and tinsel, but
tarnished and dim from the years.</p>
<p>In the center was a painting, also dark and dim in
which only a halo was still discernible in the light of the
candle, but the features of the saint pictured there were
shadowed and elusive.</p>
<p>For a moment she knelt on the lower step and bent her
head because of those remnants of a faith which was all
she knew of earthly hope,&ndash;&ndash;and then she started to mount
the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curse of God shrivel you!&rdquo; muttered Perez in
cold fury&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;come down from there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without heed to the threat, she moved the little statues
to right or left, and then lifted her hand, resting it on
the wooden frame of the painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the Americano,&rdquo; she said without turning. &ldquo;You
will need a man, but not a man of Altar. Another day
may come when you, Ramon, may have need of this
house for hiding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil strode to the door and motioned Kit to enter,
then he closed both doors and gave no heed to Perez,
crouched there like a chained coyote in a trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;You are in league
with hell to know of that. I never gave it to you! Come
down! I meant to tell after he had finished with Conrad&ndash;&ndash;I
mean to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He waited too long, and spoke too much,&rdquo; she said
to Rotil. &ldquo;Keep watch on him, and let the Americano
give help here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit mounted the step beside her, and at her gesture
took hold of the frame on one side. She found a wedge
of wood at the other side and drew it out. The loosened
frame was lifted out by Kit and carried down the three
steps; it was a panel a little over two feet in width and
four in height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set it aside, and watch Jos&eacute; Perez while General
Rotil looks within,&rdquo; she said evenly.</p>
<p>Rotil glanced at Perez scowling black hate at her, and
then turned to Jocasta who held out the candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for you to see,&ndash;&ndash;you and no other,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You have saved a woman he would have traded as a
slave, and I give you more than a slave&rsquo;s ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the candle and his eyes suddenly flamed with
exultation as her meaning came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jocasta!</i>&rdquo; he muttered as if scarce believing, and then
he mounted the step, halted an instant in the panel of
shadow, and, holding the candle over his head, he leaned
forward and descended on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned she-wolf of the hills!&rdquo; growled Perez
with the concentrated hate of utter failure in his voice.
&ldquo;I fed you, and my money covered your nakedness, and
now you put a knife in my neck and go back to cattle of
the range for a mate! You,&ndash;&ndash;without shame or soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;You killed a soul
in the <i>casita</i> of the oleanders, Jos&eacute; Perez, and it was a
dead woman you and the German chained to be buried
in the desert. But even the dead come back to help
friends who are faithful, Jos&eacute;,&ndash;&ndash;and I am as the dead
who walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not look at him as she spoke, but sank on her
knees before the dark canvas where only the faint golden
halo gave evidence of some incarnated holiness portrayed
there. Her voice was low and even, and the sadness of it
thrilled Kit. He thought of music of sweet chords, and
a broken string vibrating, for the hopelessness in her voice
held a certain fateful finality, and her delicate dark loveliness&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Rotil emerged from the doorway of the shrine and
stood there, a curious substitute for the holy picture, looking
down on her with a wonderful light in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ransom wins for you all you wish of me,&ndash;&ndash;except
the life of one man,&rdquo; he said, and with a gesture
indicated that Kit help her to her feet. He did so, and
saw that she was very white and trembling.</p>
<p>Rotil looked at Perez over her head, and Perez scowled
back, with all the venom of black hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win!&ndash;&ndash;but a curse walks where she walks. Ask
her? Ask Marto of the men she put under witchcraft!
Ask Conrad who had good luck till she hated him! If
you have a love, or a child, or anything dear, let her not
look hate on them, for her knife follows that look! Ask
her of the knife she set in the heart of a child for jealousy
of Conrad! Ai, general though you are, your whole army
is not strong enough to guard you from the ill luck you
will take with the gift <i>she</i> gives! She is a woman under
a curse. Ha! Look at her as I say it, for you hear the
truth. Ask the padre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit realized that Perez was launching against her the
direst weight of evil the Mexican or Indian mind has to
face. Though saints and heaven and hell might be denied
by certain daring souls, the potency of witchcraft was
seldom doubted. Men or women accused of it were
shunned as pariahs, and there had been known persons
who weakened and dwindled into death after accusation
had been put against them.</p>
<p>He thought of it as she cowered under each separate
count of the curse launched against her. She bent like a
slender reed under the strokes of a flail, lower and lower
against his arm, but when the deadly voice flung the final
taunt at her, she straightened slowly and looked at Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ask the padre&ndash;&ndash;or ask me!&rdquo; she said in that
velvet soft voice of utter despair. &ldquo;That I sent an innocent
soul to death is too true. To my great sorrow I did
it;&ndash;&ndash;I would do it again! For that my life is indeed a
curse to me,&ndash;&ndash;but his every other word a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she took a step forward, faltered, and fell back
into the outstretched arm of Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Se&ntilde;ora Perez to the women, and come back,&rdquo;
said Rotil. Kit noted that even though he moved close,
and bent over the white unconscious face, he did not touch
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora Perez!&rdquo; repeated Perez contemptuously.
&ldquo;You are generous with other men&rsquo;s names for your
women! Her name is the Indian mother&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half Indian,&rdquo; corrected Rotil, &ldquo;and her naming I
will decide another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit returned, and without words proceeded to help replace
the holy picture in its niche. In the struggle with
the padre, a chunk of adobe had been knocked from the
wall near the door, and he picked it up, crumbling it to
a soft powder and sprinkled it lightly over the steps
where foot prints were traceable in the dust.</p>
<p>Rotil who had gone to the door to recall the guard,
halted and watched him closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You also give me a thought concerning
this animal; he will bark if he has listeners, and
even the German should not hear&ndash;&ndash;one never knows!
I need a cage for a few hours. You have been a friend,
and know secret things. Will you lock him in your own
room and hold the key to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know,&rdquo; answered Kit though with
the uncomfortable certainty that the knowledge of too
many secret things in Mexico was not conducive to long
life for the knower. &ldquo;I may also assure you that Marto
is keen on giving you honest service that his one fault
may be atoned for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will get service,&rdquo; stated Rotil. &ldquo;You saved me
a good man there, amigo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung open the door of the corridor and whistled
for the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove this man and take your orders from Capitan&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He halted, and his eyes narrowed quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems we never were introduced, amigo, and we
know only your joy name of the singer, but there must be
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s another, all right,&rdquo; returned Kit,
knowing that Conrad would enlighten Rotil if he did not.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the hombre suspected of that Granados murder
committed by Conrad,&ndash;&ndash;and the name is Rhodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Then the scolding of these two comrades gives
to you your freedom from suspicion, eh? That is good,
but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He looked at Kit, frowning. &ldquo;See here, I
comprehend badly. You told me it was the friend of
your <i>compadre</i> who was the suspected one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;ve a dandy partner across the border. He&rsquo;s
the old man you saw at Yaqui Spring, and I reckon I&rsquo;m
a fairly good friend of his. He&rsquo;d say so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil&rsquo;s face relaxed in a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is clever, a trick and no harm in it, but&ndash;&ndash;have
a care to yourself! It is easy to be too clever, and on a
trail of war no one has time to learn if tricks are of harm
or not. Take the warning of a friend, Capitan Rhodes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the right of it, General. I have much to
learn,&rdquo; agreed Kit. &ldquo;But no man goes abroad to shout
the crimes he is accused of at home,&ndash;&ndash;and the story of
this one is very new to me. This morning I learned I
was thought guilty, and tonight I learn who is the criminal,
and how the job was done. This is quick work, and
I owe the luck of it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the good luck hold!&rdquo; said Rotil. &ldquo;And see that
the men leave you alone as the guard of Perez. I want
no listeners there.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF DO&Ntilde;A JOCASTA</h3>
</div>
<p>Ramon Rotil stood a long minute after the clank
of chains ceased along the corridor; then he bolted
the outer door of the chapel, and after casting a grim
satisfied smile at the screen of the faded canvas, he opened
the door of the <i>sala</i> and went in.</p>
<p>Valencia was kneeling beside Do&ntilde;a Jocasta and forcing
brandy between the white lips, while Elena bustled
around the padre whose head she had been bathing. A
basin of water, ruby red, was evidence of the fact that
Padre Andreas was not in immediate need of the services
of a leech. He sat with his bandaged head held in
his hands, and shrank perceptibly when the general entered
the room.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta swallowed some of the brandy, half
strangled over it, and sat up, gasping and white. It was
Tula who offered her a cup of water, while Valencia, with
fervent expressions of gratitude to the saints, got to her
feet, eyeing Rotil with a look of fear. After the wounded
priest and the fainting Jocasta emerged from the chapel
door, the two women were filled with terror of the controlling
spirit there.</p>
<p>He halted on the threshold, his eyes roving from face
to face, including Tula, who stood, back against the wall,
regarding him as usual with much admiration. One
thing more he must know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you without,&rdquo; he said with a gesture towards the
two women and the priest. &ldquo;I will speak with this lady
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all moved to the door, and after a moment of
hesitation Tula was about to follow when he stopped
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay, girl. The Do&ntilde;a Jocasta may want a maid,
but take yourself over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Tula slipped silently back into the niche of the window
seat where the shadows were deepest, and Rotil
moved towards the center table dragging a chair. On the
other side of the table was the couch on which Jocasta
sat, white and startled at the dismissal of the woman and
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be composed,&rdquo; he said gentling his tone as one would
to soothe a child. &ldquo;There are some things to be said between
us here, and too many ears are of no advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply; only inclined her head slightly and
drew herself upright against the wall, gathering the lace
<i>rebosa</i> across her bosom where Valencia had unfastened
her garments and forgotten them in her fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First is the matter of my debt to you. Do you know
in your own mind how great that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;count it as nothing, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because you do not know the great need, and
have not made count of the cases of rifles and ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, I never looked at them. Juan Gonsalvo
in dying blamed Jos&eacute; Perez for the shot. It was fired
by another hand,&ndash;&ndash;but God alone knows! So Juan sent
for me, and Jos&eacute; never knew. The secret of Soledad was
given to me then, but I never thought to use it, until&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ceased, shuddering, and he knew she was thinking
of the blood-stained priest whirled into her presence.
Fallen though the state of the priesthood might be in
Mexico, there were yet women of Jocasta&rsquo;s training to
whom an assault on the clergy was little less than a mortal
sin. He knew that, and smiled grimly at the remembrance
of her own priestly father who had refused her
in honest marriage to a man of her mother&rsquo;s class, and
was busily engaged haggling over the gift price of her
with Jos&eacute; Perez when death caught him. The bewildered
girl was swept to the estate of Perez without either marriage
or gift, unless one choose to consider as gift the
shelter and food given to a younger sister and brother.</p>
<p>All this went through his mind as she shrank and
sighed because he had tossed a priest from his way with
as slight regard as he would the poorest peon. She did
not even know how surely the destiny of her mother and
her own destiny had been formed by a priest&rsquo;s craft. She
would never know, because her mind would refuse to
accept it. There were thousands like her because of their
shadowed inheritance. Revolution for the men grew
out of that bondage of women, and Rotil had isolated
moments when he dreamed of a vast and blessed freedom
of the land&ndash;&ndash;schools, and schools, and more schools
until knowledge would belong to the people instead of to
the priests!</p>
<p>But he knew it was no use to tell thoughts like that to
women; they were afraid to let go their little wooden
saints and the jargon of prayers they did not understand.
The mystery of it held them!</p>
<p>Thus brooded Rotil, unlearned driver of burros and
general of an army of the people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will forget all but the ammunition,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is as food to my men, and some of them are starving
there to the east; with ammunition food can be commandeered.
I knew the guns were on Soledad land, but
even a golden dream of angels would not have let me
hope for as much as you have given me. It is packed,&ndash;&ndash;that
room, from floor to roof tiles. In the morning I take
the trail, and there is much to be done before I go. You;&ndash;&ndash;I
must think of first. Will you let me be your confessor,
and tell me any wish of your heart I may help you
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart has no wish left alive in it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There have been days when I had wish for the hut
under the palms where my mother lived. A childish
wish,&ndash;&ndash;but other wishes are dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no going back,&rdquo; he said, staring at the tiles,
and not looking at her. &ldquo;It is of future things we must
think. He said things&ndash;&ndash;Perez did, and you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she half whispered. &ldquo;There is no way but to
tell of it, but&ndash;&ndash;I would ask that the child wait outside.
The story is not a story for a girl child, Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned to Tula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside the door, but in call,&rdquo; he said, and without
a word or look Tula went softly out.</p>
<p>There was silence for a bit between them, her hands
were clasped at full length, and she leaned forward painfully
tense, looking not at him, but past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not easy, but you will comprehend better than
many,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;There were three of us.
There was my little brother Palemon, who ran away last
year to be a soldier&ndash;&ndash;he was only fourteen. Jos&eacute; would
not let me send searchers for him, and he may be dead.
Then there was only&ndash;&ndash;only Lucita and me. You maybe
remember Lucita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her question was wistful as if it would help her to
even know he remembered. He nodded his head in affirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A golden child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have seen pictured
saints and angels in great churches since the days in
the hills, but never once so fair a child as little Lucita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, white and gold, and an angel of innocence,&rdquo; she
said musingly. &ldquo;Always she was that, always! And
there was a sweetheart, Mariano Avila, a good lad, and
the wedding was to be. She was embroidering the wedding
shirt for Mariano when&ndash;&ndash;God! God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got up suddenly and paced the floor, her arms hugging
her shoulders tight as if to keep from sobbing. He
rose and stood watching, but uttered no word.</p>
<p>After a little she returned to the couch, and began to
speak in a more even tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much to tell. Much happened. Conrad
was driving Jos&eacute; to do many things not at first in their
plans. Also there was more drinking,&ndash;&ndash;much more! It
was Conrad made plans for the slave raids. He no
longer asked Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s permission for anything; he gave
command to the men and Jos&eacute; had to listen. Only one
secret thing was yet hidden from him, the hiding place
of the guns from the north. Jos&eacute; said if that was uncovered
he might as well give up his ranchos. In his heart
he could not trust Conrad. Each had a watch set on
the other! Juan got his death because he made rendezvous
with the German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how it was when the slave raid was made
north of here, and the most beautiful Indian girl killed
herself somewhere in this desert when there was no
other way to escape the man;&ndash;&ndash;the scar on the face
of Conrad was from her knife. It was a bad cut, and
after that there was trouble, and much drink and mad
quarrels. Also it was that time Juan Gonsalvo was shot
and died from it. Juana, his sister, came in secret for
me while he could yet speak, and that was when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She halted, closing her eyes as if to shut out some horror.
He thought she shrank from remembrance of how
the secret of Soledad was given to her, for Juan must
have been practically a dead man when he gave it up.
After a moment she went on in the sad tone of the utterly
hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak of the mad quarrels of those two men, Ramon,
but it was never of that I had fear. The fear came each
time the quarrel was done, and they again swore to be
friends, for in the new &lsquo;friend hours&rsquo; of drinking, strange
things happened, strange wagers and strange gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she paused, and this time she lifted her eyes to
Rotil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always I hated the German. I never carried a blade
until after his eyes followed me! He tried to play the
prince, the great gentleman, with me&ndash;&ndash;a girl of the hills!
Only once he touched my hand, and I scoured it with sand
afterwards while Jos&eacute; laughed. But the German did
not laugh,&ndash;&ndash;he only watched me! Once when Jos&eacute; was
in a rage with me Conrad said he could make of me a
great lady in his own land if I would listen. Instead of
listening I showed him my knife. After that God only
knows what he told against me, but Jos&eacute; became bitter&ndash;&ndash;bitter,
and jealous, and spies always at my back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Lucita and Mariano and I made plans. They
were to marry, and we three would steal away in secret
and cross the border. That was happiness to plan, for
my life&ndash;&ndash;my life was hell, so I thought! But I had
not yet learned what hell could be,&rdquo; she confessed
drearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said very gently. Those who thought
they knew &ldquo;El Gavilan,&rdquo; the merciless, would not have
recognized his voice at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had not learned,&rdquo; she went on drearily. &ldquo;I
thought that to carry a knife for myself made all safe&ndash;&ndash;I
did not know! I told you Juana Gonsalvo came for
me very secretly to hear the last words of Juan. But
I did not tell you we lived in the <i>casita</i>, little Lucita
and I. It is across a garden from the hacienda, and was
once a priest&rsquo;s house; that was in the days of the mother
of Jos&eacute;. It is very sweet there under the rose vines,
and it was sanctuary for us. When Jos&eacute; and the German
had their nights of carouse we went there and locked
ourselves in. There were iron bars on the high windows,
and shutters of wood inside, so we were never
afraid. I heard Conrad tell Jos&eacute; he was a fool not to
blow it up with dynamite some day of fiesta. It was
the night after their great quarrel, and it was a terrible
time. They were pledging friendship once more in much
wine. Officers from the town were at the hacienda with
women who were&ndash;&ndash;well, I would not go in, and Jos&eacute;
was wild. He came to the <i>casita</i> and called threats at
me. I thought the German was with him, for he said
Conrad was right, and the house would be blown up
with the first dynamite he could spare,&ndash;&ndash;but threats were
no new thing to us! I tried to soothe little Lucita by
talk of the wedding, and all the pretty bride things were
taken out of the chest and spread on the bed; one
<i>rebosa</i> of white I put over her shoulders, and the child
was dancing to show me she was no longer afraid&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was when Juana came to the window. I knew
her voice and opened the door. I did not want Lucita
frightened again, so I did not let her know a man was
dying&ndash;&ndash;only that a sick person wanted me for a little&ndash;&ndash;little
minute, and I would be back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Juan Gonsalvo had been killed because he
had been trusted far enough,&ndash;&ndash;I knew it! That thought
struck me very hard, for I&ndash;&ndash;I might be the next, and
I wanted first to send those two children happily out of
reach of sorrow. Strange it is that because she was
first, the very first in my heart, I went out that door
in the night and for the first time left her alone! But
that is how it was; we had to be so quick&ndash;&ndash;and so silent&ndash;&ndash;and
it was her hand closed the door after us, her hand
on the bolt!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan Gonsalvo had only fought for life until he could
see me, and then the breath went. No one but I heard
his whispers of the door of the picture here in Soledad.
He told me his death was murder, and his last word was
against Perez. It was only minutes, little minutes I was
there, and the way was not far, but when I went back
through the garden the door of the <i>casita</i> stood wide
and light streamed out! I do not know how I was sure
it was empty, but I was, and I seemed to go dead inside,
though I started to run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To cross that garden was like struggling in a dream
with bands about my feet. I wake with that dream many
nights&ndash;&ndash;many!&ndash;&ndash;I heard her before I could reach the
path. Her screams were not in the <i>casita</i>, but in the
hacienda. They were&ndash;&ndash;they were&ndash;&ndash;terrible! I tried
to go&ndash;&ndash;and then I knew she had broken away&ndash;&ndash;I could
see her like a white spirit fly back towards the light in
the open door. The man following her tripped in some
way and fell, and I leaped over him to follow her. We
got inside and drew the bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;But there are things not to be told&ndash;&ndash;they
belong to the dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perez came there to the door and made demands
for Conrad&rsquo;s woman,&ndash;&ndash;that is how he said it! He said
she had gone to Conrad&rsquo;s apartment of her own will and
must go back. Lucita knelt at my feet in her torn bridal
garment and told how a woman had come as Juana had
come, and said that I wanted her. The child had no
doubt, she followed, and&ndash;&ndash;and it was indeed to that
drunken beast they took her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; was also drunk, crazy drunk. He told me to
stand away from that door for they were coming in,
also that he had made gift of Lucita to his friend, and
she must be given up. Then they began to fire guns
in the lock! It seemed a long, long time she held to me
there and begged me to save her, but it could not have
been.... The lock gave way, and only the bolt
held. I clasped her close to me and whispered telling her
to pray, but I never took my eyes off the door. When I
saw it shaking, I made the sign of the cross over her,
and the knife I had carried for myself found her heart
quickly! That is how I took on me the shadow of murder,
and that is why the priest threatens me with the
fires of hell if I do not repent&ndash;&ndash;and I am not repenting,
Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, no!&rdquo; he muttered, staring into her defiant
eyes. &ldquo;That was a fine thing, and your mother gave good
blood to her children, Jocasta. And then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laid her on the bed among her bridal laces, all
white&ndash;&ndash;white! Over her breast I folded her still hands,
and set a candle at her head, though I dared not pray!
The door was giving way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pushed back the bolt, also I spoke, but it did not
seem me! That is strange, but of a truth I did not know
the voice I heard say: &lsquo;Enter, her body is yours&ndash;&ndash;and
she no longer flees from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! That is good sense at last!&rsquo; said Jos&eacute;, and
Conrad laughed and praised himself as a lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I told you so!&rsquo; he grunted. &lsquo;The little dear one
knows that a nice white German is not so bad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again I heard the voice strange to me say, &lsquo;She
knows nothing, Jos&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and she knows all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; stumbled in smiling, but Conrad, though drunk,
stopped at the door when he saw my hand with the knife.
I thought my skirt covered it as I waited for him&ndash;&ndash;for
the child had told me enough&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I failed, Ramon!
His oath was a curious choked scream as I tried to reach
him. I do not know if it was the knife, or the dead girl
on the bed made him scream like that, but I knew then
the German was at heart a coward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; was too strong for me, and the knife could not
do its work. I was struck, and my head muffled in a
<i>serape</i>. After that I knew nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days and nights went by in a locked room. I never
got out of it until I was chained hand and foot and
sent north in a peon&rsquo;s ox-cart. Men guarded me until
Marto with other men waited for me on the trail. Jos&eacute;
Perez could have had me killed, yes. Or he could have
had me before the judges for murder, but silence was
the thing he most wanted&ndash;&ndash;for there is Do&ntilde;a Dolores
Terain yet to be won. He has sent me north that the
General Terain, her father, will think me out of his life.
One of the guards told an alcalde I was his wife, he was
sure that story would be repeated back to Hermosillo!
These are days in Sonora when no one troubles about one
woman or one child who is out of sight, and we may be
sure he and Conrad had a well-made story to tell. He
knows it is now all over with me, that I have a hate of
which he is afraid, so he does not have me shot;&ndash;&ndash;he only
sends me to Soledad in the wilderness where fighting bands
of the revolution cross all trails, and his men have orders
that I am not to go out of the desert alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said Rotil thoughtfully, &ldquo;and&ndash;&ndash;it is all gone
now&ndash;&ndash;the love of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the love in the world is gone, amigo,&rdquo; she said,
looking away from him through the barred window
where the night sky was growing bright from the rising
moon. &ldquo;I was a child enchanted by the glory of the
world and his love words. Out of all that false glitter
of life I have walked, a blackened soul with a murderer&rsquo;s
hand. How could love be again with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily, the slender thing of creamy
skin and Madonna eyes that had been the Dream of
Youth to him, the one devotee at an altar in whom he had
believed&ndash;&ndash;nothing in the humanity of the world would
ever have faith of his again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, Jocasta,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you are a
woman, and in the shadow. The little golden singing one is
gone out of your life, and the new music must be different!
I will think about that for you. Go now to your sleep,
for there is work of men to be done, and the night scarce
long enough for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door for her and stood with bent head
as she passed. His men lounging in the patio could see
that manner of deference, and exchanged looks and comments.
To the victor belong the spoils in Mexico, and
here was a sweeping victory,&ndash;&ndash;yet the general looked the
other way!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, accompany the se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he said kindly to Tula
at the door. &ldquo;Chappo, bring Marto to see me. The new
American capitan said he was a man of value, and the
lad was right. Work of importance waits for him tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>RAMON ROTIL DECIDES</h3>
</div>
<p>Whatever the labors of Marto Cavayso for the
night they appeared to have been happy ones, for
ere the dawn he came to Kit&rsquo;s door in great good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amigo,&rdquo; he said jovially, &ldquo;you played me a trick and
took the woman, but what the devil is that to hold a
grudge for? My general has made it all right, and we
need help. You are to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to,&rdquo; agreed Kit, &ldquo;but what of this guard duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the door&ndash;&ndash;there is but one key. Also the other
men are not sleeping inside the portal. It is by order of
General Rotil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez awoke to glare at his false major-domo, but
uttered no words. He had not even attempted conversation
with Kit since the evening before when he stated
that no Americano could fool him, and added his conviction
that the said Americano was a secret service man
of the states after the guns, and that Rotil was a fool!</p>
<p>Kit found Rotil resting in the chapel, looking fagged
and spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marto is hell for work, and I had to stay by,&rdquo; he
grumbled with a grin. &ldquo;Almost I sent for you. No
other man knows, and behold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stacked on either side were packing cases of rifles and
ammunition, dozens and dozens of them. The dusty
canvas was back in its place and no sign to indicate
where the cases had come from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great treasure chest, that,&rdquo; stated Rotil, &ldquo;and
we have here as much as the mules can carry, for the
wagons can&rsquo;t go with us. But I want every case of this
outside the portal before dawn comes, and it comes quick!
It means work and there are only three of us, and this
limp of mine&rsquo;s a trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kit, stripping off his coat, &ldquo;if the two
of you got them up a ladder inside, and down the steps
to this point I reckon three of us can get them across
that little level on record time. Say, your crew will
think it magic when guns and ammunition are let fall for
you by angels outside of the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thought will do no harm,&rdquo; said Rotil. &ldquo;Also
I am not sure but that you speak true, and the magic was
much needed when it came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They worked fast, and ere the first hint of dawn the
cases were stacked in imposing array on the plaza. And
no sign by which they could be traced. Rotil looked at
them, and chuckled at the wonder the men would feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time they were called, for it is a long trail, go
you, Capitan, and waken them, tell them to get ready
the pack mules and get a move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but if they ask questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look wise and say nothing! When they see the cases
they will think you either the devil or San Antonio to
find what was lost in the desert. It is a favor I am doing
you, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you are! If the Indians ever get the idea that
I can win guns from out the air by hokus-pokus, I will
be a big medicine chief, and wax fat under honors in
Sonora. Head me to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil had seen to it that though sentinels stood guard
at Soledad, none were near enough the plaza to interfere
with work of the night, and Kit found their main camp
down by the <i>acquia</i> a quarter of a mile away. He gave
orders as directed for the pack animals and cook wagon
over which a son of the Orient presided. That stolid
genius was already slicing deer meat for broiling, and
making coffee, of which he donated a bowl to Kit, also
a cart wheel of a <i>tortilla</i> dipped in gravy. Both were
joyously accepted, and after seeing that the men were
aroused from the blankets, he returned to the hacienda
full of conjecture as to the developments to be anticipated
from the night&rsquo;s work. That reserve stock of ammunition
might mean salvation to the revolutionists.</p>
<p>Rain had fallen somewhere to the east in the night
time, and as the stars faded there were lines of palest
silver and palest gold in the grays of dawn on the mountains.
As he walked leisurely up the slight natural terrace
to the plaza, he halted a moment and laughed aloud
boyishly at a discovery of his, for he had solved the century-old
riddle of the view of El Alisal seen from the
&ldquo;portal&rdquo; of Soledad. The portal was not anyone of
the visible doors or gateways of the old mission, it was
the hidden portal of the picture,&ndash;&ndash;once leading to a little
balcony under which the neophytes had gathered for the
morning blessing and daily commands of their superiors!</p>
<p>That explained its height from the floor. The door had
at some later period been sealed, and a room built against
it from the side towards the mountain. In the building
of the ranch house that old strong walled section of the
mission had been incorporated as the private chapel of
some pious ranchero. It was also very, very simple after
one knew of that high portal masked by the picture, and
after one traced the line of vision from the outside and
realized all that was hidden by the old harness room and
the fragmentary old walls about it. He chuckled to think
of how he would astonish Cap Pike with the story when
he got back. He also recalled that Conrad had unburdened
his heart to him with completeness because he
was so confident an American never <i>could</i> get back!</p>
<p>He was speculating on that ever-present problem when
he noted that light shone yellow in the dawn from the
plaza windows, and on entering the patio it took but a
glance to see that some new thing was afoot.</p>
<p>Padre Andreas, with his head upholstered in strips of
the table linen, was pacing the patio reciting in a murmuring
undertone, some prayer from a small open volume,
though there was not yet light enough to read.
Valencia was bustling into the room of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta with
an olla of warm water, while Tula bore a copper tray
with fruit and coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is of a quickness, but who dare say it is not
an act for the blessing of God?&rdquo; the padre said replying
in an absent-minded manner to the greeting of Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Padre, who can say?&rdquo; agreed the latter politely,
without the slightest idea of what was meant.</p>
<p>But Marto, who fairly radiated happiness since his reinstatement,
approached with the word that General Rotil
would have him at breakfast, for which time was short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my regret that you do not ride with me, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said Rotil as he motioned him to a seat. &ldquo;But there is
work to be done at Soledad for which I shall give you
the word. I am hearing that you would help recover
some of the poor ones driven south from Palomitas, if
they be left alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pledged to that, General,&rdquo; stated Kit simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has your pledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dead man who cannot free me from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; remarked Rotil in a surprised tone. &ldquo;By
God, Don Pajarito, that is good! And it may be when
that pledge is kept, you may be free to join my children
in the fight? I make you a capitan at once, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&ndash;&ndash;after,&rdquo; agreed Rotil chuckling. &ldquo;For I tell
you there is work of importance here, and when I am
gone the thinking will be up to you! What message did
you give the muleteers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bring the animals to the plaza, and pack for the
trail all the provisions found there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provisions is good! They will burn with curiosity.
There could be fun in that if we had time to laugh and
watch them, but there is no time. Marto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marto, on guard at the door, came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the Se&ntilde;or Don Jos&eacute; Perez received my message
for conference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my General. Except that he wished your messenger
in hell, he will be happy to join you according to
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; grinned Rotil, &ldquo;it is well to conduct these
matters with grace and ceremony where a lady is concerned.
Take him to the <i>sala</i>; it is illuminated in his
honor. Come, se&ntilde;or, I want for witness an Americano
who is free from Sonora influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; queried Kit dubiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure!
I seem all tangled up with Sonora influences of all shades
and varieties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rotil&rsquo;s jocularity disappeared as he entered the sala
where quill pen and ink and some blank sheets from an
old account book gave a business-like look to the table
where four candles made a radiance.</p>
<p>Perez was there, plainly nervous by reason of the
mocking civility of Marto. His eyes followed Rotil,&ndash;&ndash;questioning,
fearful!</p>
<p>The latter passed him without notice and seated himself
at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the padre,&rdquo; he said to Marto. But that was
scarce needed as the padre was hovering near the door
waiting for the word. He seated himself by the table
at a motion from Rotil.</p>
<p>The latter turned for the first time to Perez, and bestowed
on him a long, curious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me, se&ntilde;or, that you were about to take as
bride a lovely lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez frowned in perplexity. Evidently this was the
last subject he had expected to hear touched upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;but if this is a question
of ransom we will not trouble the lady. I will arrange
your figures for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a matter of figures, Se&ntilde;or Perez. It is
a marriage we are interested in, and it is all well arranged
for you. The padre here will draw up the contract
of marriage in the old form; it is better than the
manner of today. You will give him your name, the
names of your parents, the name of your parish and
abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see you damned first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre,&rdquo; continued Rotil, giving no heed to that
heartfelt remark, &ldquo;use less than one-third of the page,
for there must be space for the record of the bride, and
below that the contract between the happy two with all
witnesses added.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Perez furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think; I know, se&ntilde;or! Later you also will
know,&rdquo; Rotil promised with grim certainty. &ldquo;This marriage
is of interest to me, and has been too long delayed.
It is now for you to say if you will be a bridegroom in
chains, or if it please you to have the irons off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cannot be! I tell you a marriage is not legal
if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;or! Your experience is less than I thought,&rdquo;
interrupted Rotil, &ldquo;and you are much mistaken,&ndash;&ndash;much!
We are all witnesses here. Se&ntilde;or Rhodes will be pleased
to unfasten those heavy chains to oblige the lady. The
chains might not be a pleasant memory to her. Women
have curious prejudices about such things! But it must
be understood that you stand quiet for the ceremony.
If not, this gun of mine will manage it that you stay
quiet forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perez stood up, baffled and beaten, but threatening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them off, you!&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;though it is a
hell of a ransom,&ndash;&ndash;and that woman will pay. Let no
one forget that her pay will be heavy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That paying is for afterwards!&rdquo; decided Rotil airily,
&ldquo;but here and now we men would see a wedding before
we leave Soledad. Capitan Rhodes, will you bring in
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit, in some wonder, went on the errand, and found
the women eager to deck her with blossoms and give some
joyous note to the wedding of the dawn, but she sat cold
and white with the flowers of the desert springtime about
her, and forbade them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He terrifies me much in sending that word to wake
me with this morning,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I tell you I will
kill myself before I live one more day of life with Jos&eacute;
Perez! I told him all my heart in the <i>sala</i> last night, and
it means not anything to Ramon Rotil;&ndash;&ndash;he would tie me
in slavery to that man I hate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, I do not know what the general means, but
I know it is not that. His work is for your service, even
though appearance is otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I go,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;I think I would have to
go anyway, but the heart would be more heavy, <i>Santa
Maria</i>!&ndash;&ndash;but this place of Soledad is strange in its ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time he had seen her frightened, but her
mouth trembled, and her eyes sought the floor.</p>
<p>He reached out and took her hand; it was terribly
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, and trust Rotil,&rdquo; he said reassuringly.
&ldquo;When you sift out the whole situation that is about all
left to any of us here in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led her along the corridor, the women following.
Men with pack animals were gathering in wonder around
the cases in the plaza, and through the portal they saw
the impromptu bridal procession, and fell silent. The
Americano appeared to have a hand in every game,&ndash;&ndash;and
that was a matter of wonder.</p>
<p>As they entered, Padre Andreas was reading aloud the
brief history of Jocasta Benicia Sandoval, eldest daughter
of Teresa Sandoval and Ignatius Sanchez of Santa
Ysobel in the Sierras. Padre Andreas had balked at
writing the paternity of children of Teresa Sandoval, but
a revolver in Rotil&rsquo;s hand was the final persuader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to be all an honest record for which there are
witnesses in plenty,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Teresa Sandoval had
only one lover,&ndash;&ndash;even though Padre Ignatius Sanchez
did call her daughters nieces of his! But the marriage
record of Se&ntilde;ora Jocasta Sandoval shall have only
truth.&rdquo; Jocasta wrote her name to the statement
as directed, and noted that Jos&eacute; had already
signed.</p>
<p>She did not look at him, but moved nearer to Rotil and
kept her eyes on the table. He noted her shrinking and
turned to the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these two people will write their
names together on the contract, but this is a marriage
without kisses or clasping of hands. It is a civil contract
bound by word of mouth, and written promise, under
witness of the church. Read the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight hesitation on the part of Perez when
asked if he would take Jocasta Sandoval as wife, but the
gun of Rotil hastened his decision, and his voice was defiantly
loud. Jocasta followed quietly, and then in a
benediction which was emptiest mockery, Jos&eacute; Perez and
Jocasta Sandoval were pronounced man and wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I now go?&rdquo; she murmured, but the contract was
signed by all present before Rotil nodded to Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have the honor of conducting the Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta Perez to breakfast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rest of us
have other business here. Se&ntilde;ora, will you do us the
favor to outline to this gentleman the special tasks you
would like attention given at once. There are some Indian
slaves in the south for whom the Palomitas people
ask help. You are now in a position to be of service there,
and it would be a good act with which to establish a new
rule at Soledad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, General Rotil,&rdquo; she answered, rather bewildered
by the swiftness with which he turned over to
her the duties devolving upon her newly acquired position.
&ldquo;I am not wise in law, but what I can I will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that will be nothing!&rdquo; volunteered Perez. &ldquo;A
woman of my name will not make herself common in the
markets or law courts,&ndash;&ndash;to have her Indian ancestry cast
in my teeth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Rotil humorously, &ldquo;there is not so
much! The father of Teresa Sandoval was the priestly
son of a marquise of Spain! only one drop of Indian to
three of the church in the veins of Se&ntilde;ora Perez, so you
perceive she has done honor to your house. You will
leave your name in good hands when God calls you to
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit noted the sudden tension of Perez at the last sentence,
and a look of furtive, fearful questioning in his
eyes as he looked at Rotil, who was folding the marriage
contract carefully, wrapping it in a sheet of paper for
lack of an envelope.</p>
<p>But, as squire of dames, Kit was too much occupied
to give further heed to business in the <i>sala</i>. Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta expressed silently a desire to get away from there
as soon as might be; she looked white and worn, and cast
at Rotil a frightened imploring glance as she clung to
Kit&rsquo;s arm. He thought he would have to carry her
before they crossed the patio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Ramon laughs like that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began and
then went silent, shuddering. Kit, remembering the look
in the eyes of Perez, did not care to ask questions.</p>
<p>The older women went back to the kitchen to finish
breakfast and gossip over the amazing morning, but Tula
remained near Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,&ndash;&ndash;seeing all and her ears
ever open.</p>
<p>Padre Andreas followed, under orders from Rotil, who
told him to do any writing required of him by the Se&ntilde;ora
Perez, and arrange for safe couriers south when she
had messages ready. His knowledge of villages and
rancheros was more dependable than that of the vaqueros;
he would know the names of safe men.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta sighed, and looked from one to the other
appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much, very much to plan for before the sun
is showing,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Is there not some little
time to think and consider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now the men of Ramon Rotil are packing the
beasts for the trail,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and he wants all
your plans and desires stated before he goes east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> desires!&rdquo; and her smile held bitterness as she
turned to Kit. &ldquo;You, se&ntilde;or, have never seen the extent
of the Perez holdings in Sonora. They are so vast that
one simple woman like me would be lost in any plans of
change there. Jos&eacute; Perez meant what he said;&ndash;&ndash;no
woman can take control while he lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, there are some things a woman could do best,&rdquo;
ventured Kit, &ldquo;the things of mercy;&rdquo; and he mentioned
the Palomitas slaves&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. Also I am in debt for much friendship,
and this child of Palomitas must have the thing she asks.
Tell me the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn from Perez which ranch of General Estaban
Terain shelters the political prisoners taken from the district
of Altar,&rdquo; suggested Kit. &ldquo;Either Perez or Conrad
can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta looked at the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Perez will hate you for this marriage, and we
must seek safety for you in some other place,&rdquo; she said
kindly, &ldquo;but you are the one most able to learn this
thing. Will it please you to try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Andreas went out without a word. In his heart
he resented the manner of the marriage ceremony, and
scarce hoped Perez would be acquiescent or disposed to
further converse, and he personally had no inclination
to ask help of the General Rotil.</p>
<p>He was surprised as he crossed the patio to see Perez,
still free from chains, walking through the portal to the
plaza with Marto Cavayso beside him. He was led past
the ammunition cases, and the men in their jubilant work
of packing the mules. Far out up the valley to the north
a cloud of dust caught the red glow of sunrise, and the
priest knew the vaqueros with the Soledad cattle were
already on the trail for the main body of revolutionists
in the field.</p>
<p>Saddle horses were held a little apart in the plaza, and
Padre Andreas hastened his steps lest they mount and be
gone, but Marto spoke to him sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk in front to do your talking,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;This gentleman is not inviting company for his
<i>pasear</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; Perez turned a startled, piercing look on the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Rotil send you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, I came back to ask a simple thing concerning
the Altar people who went south for Yucatan.
Can you give me the name of the ranch where they are
held?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&ndash;&ndash;but I give nothing for nothing!&rdquo; he said bitterly.
&ldquo;Already I am caught in a trap by that marriage,
and I will see that the archbishop hears of your share
in it. Nothing for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet there may be some service I can give, or send
south, for you,&rdquo; said the priest.</p>
<p>Perez regarded him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;you might get a message to General Terain
that I am a prisoner, on my own estate&ndash;&ndash;if Rotil does
not have you killed on the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could try,&rdquo; agreed the priest. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I might secure
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, se&ntilde;or. I could not attempt it without the
word of General Rotil,&rdquo; announced Padre Andreas. &ldquo;Of
what use to risk the life of a courier for no purpose? But
I make a bargain: if you will tell which ranch the Altar
Indians were driven to I will undertake to get word for
you to a friend. Of course I can get the information from
the German if you say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the German!&rdquo; swore Perez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Father,&rdquo; said Marto, &ldquo;you halt us on the way to
join the advance, and we have no mind to take all the dust
of the mule train. Make your talk of fewer words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go to the German?&rdquo; repeated the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&ndash;&ndash;let him rot alone! The plantation is Linda
Vista, and Conrad lied to General Terain to get them
housed there. He thought they were rebels who raided
ranches in Altar,&ndash;&ndash;political prisoners. Take General
Terain word that I am a prisoner of the revolutionists,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, the sun is too high for idle talk,&rdquo; said Marto
briefly, &ldquo;and your saddle waits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest held the stirrup for Jos&eacute; Perez, who took
the courtesy as a matter of course, turning in the saddle
and casting a bitter look at the sun-flooded walls of
Soledad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To marry a mistress and set her up as the love of
another lover&ndash;&ndash;<i>two</i> other lovers!&ndash;&ndash;is not the game of
a man,&rdquo; he growled moodily. &ldquo;If it was to do over,
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take other thoughts with you,&rdquo; said Padre Andreas
sadly, &ldquo;and my son, go with God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his hand in blessing, and stood thus after
they had turned away. Perez uttered neither thanks nor
farewell.</p>
<p>The men, busy with the final packing, stared after him
with much curiosity, and accosted the priest as he paced
thoughtfully back to the portal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, is this ammunition a gift of Don Jos&eacute;, or is
it magic from the old monks who hid the red gold of
El Alisal and come back here to guard it and haunt Soledad?&rdquo;
inquired one of the boldest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no hauntings, and that red gold has led
enough men astray in the desert. It is best forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But strange things do come about,&rdquo; insisted another
man. &ldquo;Marto Cavayso swore he had witchcraft put on
him by the green, jewel eyes of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, and you
see that since she follows our general he has the good luck,
and this ammunition comes to him from God knows
where!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be the Americano knows,&rdquo; hazarded the first
speaker. &ldquo;He took her from Marto, and rides ever beside
her. Who proves which is the enchanter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ill work to put the name of &lsquo;enchantment&rsquo;
against any mortal,&rdquo; chided the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; conceded the soldier, &ldquo;but we have
had speech of this thing, and look you!&ndash;&ndash;Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
rode in chains until the Americano crossed her trail, and
Don Ramon, and all of us, searched in vain for the
American guns, until the Americano rode to Soledad!
Enchantment or not, he has luck for his friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please!&rdquo; conceded the priest with more indifference
than he felt. The Americano certainly did not
belong to Soledad, and the wonder was that Ramon Rotil
gave him charge of so beauteous a lady. Padre Andreas
could easily perceive how the followers of Rotil thought
it enchantment, or any other thing of the devil.</p>
<p>Instinctively he disapproved of Rhodes&rsquo; position in
the group; his care-free, happy smile ill fitted the situation
at Soledad. Before the stealing away of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
she had been as a dead woman who walked; her sense
of overwhelming sin was gratifying in that it gave every
hope of leading to repentance, but on her return the
manner of her behavior was different. She rode like
a queen, and even the marriage was accepted as a justice!
Padre Andreas secretly credited the heretic Americano
with the change, and Mexican girls put no such
dependence on a man outside of her own family,&ndash;&ndash;unless
that man was a lover!</p>
<p>He saw his own influence set aside by the stranger and
the rebel leader, and with Do&ntilde;a Jocasta as a firebrand
he feared dread and awful things now that Rotil had
given her power.</p>
<p>He found her with bright eyes and a faint flush in
her cheeks over the letter Kit was writing to the south.
It was her first act as the wife of Jos&eacute; Perez, and it
was being written to the girl whom Perez had hoped
to marry!</p>
<p>Kit got considerable joy in framing her request as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='lalign'>To<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Se&ntilde;orita Dolores Terain,<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>Linda Vista Rancho, Sonora,</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Honored Se&ntilde;orita</span>:</p>
<p>As a woman who desires to secure justice and mercy for
some poor peons of our district of Altar, I venture to address
you, to whom womanly compassion must belong as
does beauty and graciousness.</p>
<p>This is a work for the charity of women, rather than
debates in law courts by men.</p>
<p>I send with this the names of those poor people who were
herded south for slavery by Adolf Conrad, a German who
calls himself American. To your father, the illustrious General
Terain, this man Conrad represented these poor people
as rebels and raiders of this region. It is not true. They
were simple peaceful workers on little ranches.</p>
<p>They were given shelter at your rancho of Linda Vista
to work for their food until they could be deported, but I
send with this a payment of gold with which to repay any
care they have been, or any debts incurred. If it is not
enough, I pledge myself to the amount you will regard as
justice.</p>
<p>Dear Se&ntilde;orita, my husband, Don Jos&eacute;, warns me that
women cannot manage such affairs, but we can at least try.
Parents wait here for sons and daughters, and little children
wait for their parents. Will you aid in the Christian task
of bringing them together quickly?</p>
<p class='ralign'>At your service with all respect,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Jocasta Benicia Perez</span>,<span class='rindent6'>&nbsp;</span><br />
Soledad Rancho, Sonora.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But you write here of gold sent by messenger, se&ntilde;or!&ndash;&ndash;I
have no gold, only words can I send,&rdquo; protested
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the words are more precious than all,&rdquo; Kit
assured her. &ldquo;It is the right word we have waited for,
and you alone could give it, se&ntilde;ora. These people have
held the gold ransom while waiting that word, and this
child can bring it when the time is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta regarded Tula doubtfully; she certainly
gave no appearance of holding wealth to redeem a pueblo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&ndash;&ndash;the little one to whom even the Deliverer
listens?&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;But the wealth of a little
Indian ranch would not seem riches to this illustrious
lady, the Do&ntilde;a Dolores Terain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet will I bring riches to her or to you, Excellencia,
if only my mother and my sister are coming again to
Palomitas,&rdquo; said Tula earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whence comes wealth to you in a land where
there is no longer wealth for anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit listened with little liking for the conversation after
the padre entered. It was a direct question, and to be
answered with directness, and he watched Tula anxiously
lest she say the wrong thing. But she told the straight
truth in a way to admit of no question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago my father got gold for sacred prayer reasons;
he hid it until he was old; when he died he made
gift of it to me that my mother and sister buy freedom.
That is all, Excellencia, but the gold is good gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped her hand under her skirt and unfastened
the leather strings of the burro-skin belt,&ndash;&ndash;it fell heavily
on the tile floor. She untied the end of it and poured a
handful on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, se&ntilde;ora, there is riches enough to go with
your words, but never enough to pay for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santa Maria!</i>&rdquo; cried the amazed priest. &ldquo;That is
<i>red</i> gold! In what place was it found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula laid her hand over the nuggets and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That secret was the secret of Miguel who is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;some old Indian must know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula shook her head with absolute finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No old Indian in all the world knows that!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;This was a secret of the youth of Miguel, and only
when old and dying did he give it for his people. This I,&ndash;&ndash;Tula,
child of Miguel tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Andreas looked from the girl to Kit and back
again, knowing that the death of Miguel was a recent
thing since it had occurred after the stealing of the
women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did your father die?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hills of the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;who had absolving and burial of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolving I do not know, but this man, his friend,
had the making of the grave,&rdquo; she said, indicating Kit,
and the eyes of the priest rested again on Kit with a
most curious searching regard. Evidently even this little
Indian stray of the desert arrived at good fortune under
the friendship of the American stranger,&ndash;&ndash;and it was another
added to the list of enchantings!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he murmured meaningly, &ldquo;then this strange
se&ntilde;or also has the knowing of this Indian gold? Is it
truly gold of the earth, or witches&rsquo; gold of red clay?&rdquo;
and he went nearer, reaching his hand to touch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all this question when the child offers it for a
good Christian use?&rdquo; demanded Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. &ldquo;See,
here is a piece of it heavy enough to weigh down many
lumps of clay, and north or south it will prove welcome
ransom. It is a miracle sent by the saints at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the saints send the red gold of El Alisal to a
heretic instead of a son of the church?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And
this is that gold for which the padres of Soledad paid
with their lives long ago. There was never such red gold
found in Sonora as that, and the church had its own claim
on it;&ndash;&ndash;it is mission gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now,&rdquo; said Tula, addressing Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;truly
not now! They claimed it long ago, but the
holding of it was a thing not for them. Fire came out of
the clouds to kill them there, and no one saw them alive
anymore, and no other priest ever found the gold. This
much is found by Miguel, for a dead man&rsquo;s promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl speaks straight, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; ventured Kit. &ldquo;I
have already told General Rotil of the promise, but no
good will come of much talk over the quality of gold for
that ransom. To carry that message south and bring
back the women is a task for council, but outside these
walls, no tongue must speak of the gold, else there would
be no safety for this maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet a priest may ask how an Americano comes far
from his home to guard gold and a maid in Sonora?&rdquo;
retorted Padre Andreas. &ldquo;Strange affairs move these
days in Altar&ndash;&ndash;guns, ammunition, and the gold of dead
men! In all these things you have a say, se&ntilde;or, yet you
are but young in years, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; interrupted Do&ntilde;a Jocasta with a note of command,
&ldquo;he was old enough to save this child from starvation
in the desert, and he was old enough to save me when
even you could no longer save me, so why object because
he has guarded wealth, and means to use it in a way
of mercy? Heretic he may be, but he has the trust of
Ramon Rotil, and of me. Also it is forbidden to mention
this belt or what it covers. I have given my word,
and this is no time to halt the task we have set. It would
better serve those lost people if you help us find a messenger
who is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time the new Se&ntilde;ora Perez assumed a
tone of authority at Soledad, and Kit Rhodes thanked his
lucky stars that she was arrayed with him instead of
against him, for her eyes glowed green lightning on the
priest whose curiosity had gotten him into trouble. Kit
could not really blame him, for there was neither priest
nor peon of the land who had not had visions of conquest
if only the red gold of the Alisal should be conveniently
stumbled upon!</p>
<p>And Tula listened to the words of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta as she
would have listened to a god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;The trail it is strange to
me, but I will find that way. I think I find in the dark
that trail on which the mother of me was going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta patted the hand of the girl, but looked
at Kit. &ldquo;That trail is not for a maid,&rdquo; she said meaningly.
&ldquo;I came over it, and know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is for me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The promise
was mine. I know none of the people, but the names are
written. It is eighty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More, double that,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, and the eyes
of Tula met his in disapproval. It was the merest hint of
a frown, but it served. She could do the errand better
than she could guard the rest of the gold. If her little
belt was lost it was little, but if his store should be found
it would be enough to start a new revolution in Sonora;&ndash;&ndash;the
men of Rotil and the suspicious padre would unite
on the treasure trail. It was the padre who gave him
most uneasiness, because the padre was guessing correctly!
The dream of a mighty church of the desert to
commemorate all the ruined missions of the wilderness,
was a great dream for the priest of a little pueblo, and
the eyes of the Padre Andreas were alight with keen,&ndash;&ndash;too
keen, anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; stated Tula again. &ldquo;No other one is knowing
my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a true word,&rdquo; decided Padre Andreas, &ldquo;a
major-domo of evil mind at Linda Vista could take the
gold and send north whatever unruly vagabonds he had
wished to be free from. Let the maid go, and I can
arrange to see her there safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This kind offer did not receive the approval deserved.
Kit wished no man on the trail with Tula who knew of
the gold, and Tula herself was not eager to journey into
unknown regions with a man of religion, who had already
learned from Valencia of the elaborate ceremony planned
for a &ldquo;Judas day!&rdquo; Little though Tula knew of churchly
observances, she had an instinctive fear that she would
be detained in the south too long to officiate in this special
ceremony on which she had set her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with a priest will I go,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He
would shut me in a school, and in that place I would
die. Clodomiro can go, or Isidro, who is so good and
knowing all our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good thought,&rdquo; agreed Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, who
had no desire that Padre Andreas meet the family of
Terain and recount details of the Perez marriage,&ndash;&ndash;not
at least until she had worn her official title a little longer
and tested the authority it gave her. &ldquo;That is a good
thought, for I have no wish that my house be left without
a priest. Se&ntilde;or Rhodes, which man is best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before Kit could answer Ramon Rotil stood in
the door, and his eyes went to the papers on the table.
Tula had recovered her belt, and fastened it under the
<i>manta</i> she wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! you are working in council, eh?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And
have arrived at plans? First your own safety, se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&ndash;&ndash;first the bringing back of the people
driven off by the slavers. The letter is written; this
child is to take it because the people are her people, but
a safe man is wanted, and these two I cannot let go. You
know Jos&eacute; Perez, and his wife must not be without a man
of religion as guard, yet he alone would not save me
from others, hence the American se&ntilde;or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that is a safe thought,&rdquo; and he took the seat
offered by Kit. But he shook his head after listening to
their suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Isidro is too old, and Clodomiro with his flying
ribbands of a would-be lover, is too young for that trail.
You want&ndash;&ndash;you want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused as his mind evidently went searching among
his men for one dependable. Then he smiled at Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved me the right man, se&ntilde;or! Who would be
better than the foreman of Soledad? Would it not be
expected that Se&ntilde;ora Perez would send the most important
of the ranchmen? Very well then. Marto is
safe, he will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Marto&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Padre Andreas, when Rotil
faced about, staring him into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marto will return here to Soledad today,&rdquo; he said,
and the face of the priest went pale. It was as if he had
said that the task of Marto on the east trail would be
ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Marto Cavayso has been at Hermosillo,&rdquo; assented
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. &ldquo;He will know all the ways to
arrive quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be attended to. Will you, se&ntilde;or, see to it
that horse and provision are made ready for the trail?
And you, se&ntilde;ora? Soledad in the wilderness is no good
place for a lady. When this matter of the slaves is arranged,
will it please you to ride south, or north? Troops
of the south will be coming this way;&ndash;&ndash;it will be a land
of soldiers and foraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I answer that?&rdquo; murmured Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
miserably. &ldquo;In the south Jos&eacute; Perez may make life a not
possible thing for me,&ndash;&ndash;and in the north I would be a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Perez will not make trouble; yet trouble might
be made,&ndash;&ndash;at first,&rdquo; said Rotil avoiding her eyes, and
turning again to Kit. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, by the time Marto gets
back from the south, the pack mules will be here again.
Until they are gone from Soledad I trust you in charge of
Se&ntilde;ora Perez. She must have a manager, and there is
none so near as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At her service,&rdquo; said Kit promptly, &ldquo;but this
place&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ai, that is it,&rdquo; agreed Rotil. &ldquo;North is the safer place
for women alone, and you&ndash;&ndash;did you not say that on
Granados there were friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, General,&rdquo; replied Kit. &ldquo;My friend, Captain
Pike, is somewhere near, and the owner of Granados
is a lady, and among us we&rsquo;ll do our best. But it&rsquo;s a hard
trip, and I&rsquo;ve only one gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take your choice of guns, horses, or men,&rdquo;
decided Rotil. &ldquo;That is your work. Also you will take
with you the evidence of Se&ntilde;ora Perez on that matter of
the murder. The padre can also come in on that,&ndash;&ndash;so it
will be service all around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chappo came to the door to report that all was ready
for the trail, and Rotil stood up, and handed to Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta the marriage contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider the best way of protecting this until you
reach an alcalde and have a copy made and witnessed,&rdquo;
he said warningly. &ldquo;It protects your future. The fortunes
of war may take all the rest of us, but the wife of
Perez needs the record of our names; see to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him as if to speak, but no words
came. He gazed curiously at her bent head, and the
slender hands over the papers. In his life of turmoil and
bloodshed he had halted to secure for her the right to a
principality. In setting his face to the east, and the battle
line, he knew the chance was faint that he would ever
see her again, and his smile had in it a touch of self-derision
at the thought,&ndash;&ndash;for after all he was nothing
to her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&ndash;&ndash;that is all,&rdquo; he said, turning away. &ldquo;You come
with me a little ways, se&ntilde;or, and to you, se&ntilde;ora, <i>adios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with God, Ramon Rotil,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and if
ever a friend is of need to you, remember the woman to
whom you gave justice and a name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adios</i>,&rdquo; he repeated, and his spurs tinkled as he strode
through the patio to the portal where the saddle horses
were waiting. The pack mules were already below the
mesa, and reached in a long line over the range towards
the ca&ntilde;on of the eastern trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your work cut out,&rdquo; he said to Kit. &ldquo;For
one thing, Marto Cavayso will carry out orders, but you
must not have him enter a room where Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
may be. It would be to offend her and frighten him. He
swears to the saints that he was bewitched. That is as
may be, but it is an easy way out! When the pack mules
come back, and Marto is here, it is for you two to do
again the thing we did last night. I may need Soledad
on another day, and would keep all its secrets. After you
have loaded the last of the guns it is best for you to go
quickly. Here is a permit in case you cross any land
held by our men;&ndash;&ndash;it is for you, your family, and all
your baggage without molestation. Se&ntilde;ora Perez has the
same. This means you can take over the border any of
the furnishings of Soledad required by the lady for a
home elsewhere. The wagons sent north by Perez will
serve well for that, and they are hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he should send men of his own to interfere&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; stated Rotil. &ldquo;You are capitan, and
Soledad is under military rule. There is only one soul
here over which your word is not law. I have given the
German Judas to your girl, and the women can have their
way with him. He is as a dead man; call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need, for Tula had followed at a discreet
distance, and from beside a pillar gazed regretfully
after her hero, the Deliverer, whom she felt every man
should follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oija, muchacha!</i>&rdquo; he said as Kit beckoned her forward,
&ldquo;go to Fidelio. He is over there filling the cantins
at the well. Tell him to give you the key to the
quarters of El Aleman, and hearken you!&ndash;&ndash;I wash my
hands of him from this day. If you keep him, well, but
if he escapes, the loss is to you. I go, and not again will
Ramon Rotil trap a Judas for your hellishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tula sped to Fidelio, secured the key and was back to
hold the stirrup of Rotil as he was helped to the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God had made me a man instead of a maid, I
would ride the world as your soldier, my General,&rdquo; she
said, holding the key to her breast as an amulet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send your lovers instead,&rdquo; he said, and laughed,
&ldquo;for you will have them when you get more beef on
your bones. <i>Adios</i>, soldier girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She peered up at him under her mane of black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself,&ndash;&ndash;I think that is true,&rdquo; she stated gravely,
&ldquo;also my lovers, when they come, must follow you!
When I see my own people safe in Palomitas it may be
that I, Tula, will also follow you,&ndash;&ndash;and the help of the
child of Miguel may not be a little help, my General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes alone knew what she meant. Her intense
admiration for the rebel leader of the wilderness had
brought the glimmer of a dream to her;&ndash;&ndash;the need of
gold was great as the need of guns, and for the deliverer
of the tribes what gift too great?</p>
<p>But the others of the guard laughed at the crazy saying
of the brown wisp of a girl. They had seen women of
beauty give him smiles, and more than one girl follow
his trail for his lightest word, but to none of them
did it occur that this one called by him the young crane,
or the possessor of many devils, could bring more power
to his hand than a regiment of the women who were
comrades of a light hour.</p>
<p>But her solemnity amused Rotil, and he swept off
his hat with exaggerated courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I await the day, Tulita. Sure, bring your lovers,&ndash;&ndash;and
later your sons to the fight! While you wait for
them tell Marto Cavayso he is to have a care of you as
if you were the only child of Ramon Rotil! I too will
have a word with him of that. See to it, Capitan of the
roads, and <i>adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned at the play upon the name of Rhodes, and
whirled his horse, joining his men, who sat their mounts
and watched at a little distance.</p>
<p>Within the portal was gathered all those left of the
household of Soledad to whom the coming and the
going of the revolutionary leader was the great event
of their lives, and all took note of the title of &ldquo;Capitan&rdquo;
and the fact that the Americano and the Indian girl had
his last spoken words.</p>
<p>They had gone scarce a mile when Fidelio spurred
his horse back and with Mexican dash drew him back
on his haunches as Kit emerged from the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Rotil&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo; he said with a grin,
&ldquo;and Marto will report to you any event requiring written
record,&ndash;&ndash;and silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that again and say it slow,&rdquo; suggested Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the word as he said it, Capitan, &lsquo;requiring
the writing of records, and&ndash;&ndash;silence!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; said Kit, and with a flourish and a clatter,
Fidelio was soon lost in the dust.</p>
<p>Kit was by no means certain that he did &ldquo;get&rdquo; him.
He felt that he had quite enough trouble without addition
of records and secrecy for acts of the Deliverer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN OF TULA</h3>
</div>
<p>The sentinel palms of Soledad were sending long
lines of shadows toward the blue range of the
Sierras, and gnarled old orange trees in the ancient
mission garden drenched the air with fragrance from
many petals.</p>
<p>There had been a sand storm the day before, followed
by rain, and all the land was refreshed and sparkling.
The pepper trees swung tassels of bloom and the flaming
coral of the occotilla glowed like tropic birds poised on
wide-reaching wands of green. Meadow larks echoed
each other in the tender calls of nesting time, and from
the jagged peaks on the east, to far low hills rising out
of a golden haze in the west, there was a great quiet
and peace brooding over the old mission grounds of
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta paced the outer corridor, watched somberly
by Padre Andreas on whom the beauty of the
hour was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your heart turned stone that you lift no hand, or
speak no word for the soul of a mortal?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Already the terrible women of Palomitas are coming
to wait for their Judas, and this is the morning of the
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no work of mine, Padre,&rdquo; she answered wearily.
&ldquo;I am sick,&ndash;&ndash;here!&ndash;&ndash;that the beast has been all
these days and nights under a roof near me. I know how
the women feel, though I think I would not wait, as they
have waited,&ndash;&ndash;for Good Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is murder in your heart to harbor such wickedness
of thought,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Your soul is in jeopardy
that you do not contemplate forgiveness. Even though
a man be a heretic, a priest must do his office when it
comes to a sentence of death. After all&ndash;&ndash;he is a human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know that,&rdquo; replied Do&ntilde;a Jocasta thoughtfully,
and she sank into a rawhide chair in the shade of
a pillar. &ldquo;Listen, Padre. I am not learned in books,
but I have had new thoughts with me these days. Don
Pajarito is telling me of los Alemanos all over the
world;&ndash;&ndash;souls they have not, and serpents and toads are
their mothers! Here in Mexico we have our flag from
old Indian days with the eagle and the snake. Once
I heard scholars in Hermosillo talk about that; they
said it was from ancient times of sky worship, and the
bird was a bird of stars,&ndash;&ndash;also the serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Andreas lifted his brows in derision at the
childishness of Indian astrology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, I think the Indian sky knowers had the
prophet sight,&rdquo; went on Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. &ldquo;They make
their eagle on the standard and they put the serpent
there of the reason that some day a thing of poison
would crawl to the nest of the eagle of Mexico to comrade
there. It has crawled over the seas for that,
Padre, and the beak and claws and wing of the eagle
must all do battle to kill the head and the heart of it;&ndash;&ndash;for
the heart of a serpent dies hard, and they breed
and hatch their eggs everywhere in the soil of Mexico.
Se&ntilde;or Padre, the Indian women of Palomitas are right!&ndash;&ndash;the
girl Tula is a child of the eagle, and her stroke at
the heart of the German snake will be a true stroke. I
will not be one to give the weak word for mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gaze, through half-closed lids, was directed towards
the far trail of the ca&ntilde;on where moving dots of
dark marked the coming of the Palomitas women. A
ray of reflected light touched the jewel green of her
eyes like shadowed emeralds in their dusky casket, and
the priest, constantly proclaiming the probable loss of
her soul, could not but bring his glance again and again
to the wondrous beauty of her. She had bloomed like
a royal rose in the days of serene rest at Soledad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the heretic Americano gives you these thoughts
which are not Christian, it will be a day of good luck
when you see the last of him,&rdquo; was his cold statement as
he watched her. &ldquo;My mind is not well satisfied as to
his knowledge of secret things here in Sonora. The
Indians say he is an enchanter or Ramon Rotil would
never have left him here as capitan with you,&ndash;&ndash;and that
belt of gold&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not the belt of the Americano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he <i>knows</i>! I tell you that gold is of the gold
lost before we were born,&ndash;&ndash;the red gold of the padres&rsquo;
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the old women are telling me that the gold was
Indian gold long before Spanish priests saw the land!
Does the Indian girl then not have first right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None has right ahead of the church, since all those
pagans are under the rule of church! They are benighted
heathen who must come under instruction and
authority, else are they as beasts of the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&ndash;&ndash;if the girl makes use of her little heritage for
a pious purpose&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her intent has nothing to do with that secret knowledge
of the Americano!&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Has he bewitched
you also that you have so little interest in a
mine of gold in anyone of the arroyas of your land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at that without turning her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a mountain of gold should be uncovered at Soledad,
of what difference to me? Would he let a woman
make traffic with it? Surely not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Perez,&ndash;&ndash;who else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Andreas closed his eyes a moment and arose,
but did not answer. He paced the length of the corridor
and back before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for you to ask the Americano that the prisoner
be given a priest if he wants prayer,&rdquo; he said returning
to their original subject of communication. &ldquo;It is a
duty that I tell you this; it is your own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Rhodes is capitan,&rdquo; she returned indifferently.
&ldquo;It is his task to give me rest here to prepare for that
long north journey. I do not rest in my mind or my
soul when you talk to me of the German snake, so I
will ask that you speak with Capitan Rhodes. He has
the knowing of Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much for safety of us,&rdquo; commented the priest
darkly. &ldquo;Who is to say how he uses it with the Indians?
It is well known that the American government
would win all this land, and work with the Indians that
they help win it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So everyone is saying in Hermosillo,&rdquo; agreed Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta, &ldquo;but the American capitan has not told me lies
of any other thing, and he is saying that is a lie made by
foreign people. Also&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and she looked at him doubtfully,
&ldquo;the man Conrad cursed your name yesterday
as a damned Austrian whose country had cost his country
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was not Austrian!&rdquo; retorted Padre Andreas,
&ldquo;and all my childhood was in Mexico. But how
did Conrad know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told Elena it was his business to know such
things. The Germans help send many Mexican priests
north over the border. He had the thought that you are
to go with me for some reason political of which I knew
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Did <i>I</i> come in willingness to this wilderness?
From the beginning to the end I am as a prisoner here;&ndash;&ndash;as
much a prisoner as is El Aleman behind the bars!
No horse is mine;&ndash;&ndash;if I walk abroad for my own health
a vaquero ever is after me that I ride back with no
fatigue to myself! It is the work of the heretic Americano
who will have his own curse for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fumed nervously over the unexpected thrust of
Austrian ancestry, and the beautiful eyes of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
regarded him with awakened interest. She had
never thought of his politics, or possible affiliations, but
after all it was true that he had been stationed at a
pueblo where everything on wheels must pass coming
north towards the border, also that was a very small
pueblo to support a padre, and perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she said after a moment, &ldquo;but for the
Americano you would be a dead man. Think you what
Ramon would have done to a priest who let a vaquero
carry me to the ranges! Also I came back to Soledad
because the Americano told me it was only duty and
justice that I come for your sake as Ramon has no liking
for priests. You see, se&ntilde;or, our American capitan
of Soledad is not so bad;&ndash;&ndash;he had a care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much a care of me!&rdquo; retorted the priest.
&ldquo;Know you not that the door of my sleeping room is
bolted each night, and unbolted at dawn? He laughs
with a light heart, and sings foolishly,&ndash;&ndash;your new Americano;
but under that cloak of the simple his plotting is
not idle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, I think his light heart is not so light
these days,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Jocasta. &ldquo;Two days now the
Indian girl and Marto Cavayso could have been back in
Soledad, and he is looking, looking ever over that empty
trail. Before the sun was above the sierra today he was
far there coming across the mesa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man does not go in the dark to look for a trail,&rdquo;
said Padre Andreas meaningly. &ldquo;He unbolted my door
on his return, and to me he looked as a man who has
done work that was heavy. What work is there for him
to do alone in the hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? A horse herd is somewhere in a ca&ntilde;on
beyond. There are colts, and the storm of yesterday
might make trouble. The old father of Elena says that
storm has not gone far and will come back! And while
the Americano rides to learn of colts, and strays, he also
picks the best mules for our journey to the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he find the best mules with packs already on
their backs in the ca&ntilde;ons?&rdquo; demanded the padre skeptically.
&ldquo;From my window I saw them return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also,&rdquo; confessed Do&ntilde;a Jocasta amused at the persistence
of suspicion, &ldquo;and the load was the water bags
and <i>serape</i>! Does any but a fool go into the wilderness
without water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cover him well, se&ntilde;ora, but I think it was not
horses he went in the night to count,&rdquo; said the priest
sarcastically. &ldquo;Gold in the land is to him who finds it,&ndash;&ndash;and
I tell you the church will hear of that red gold belt
from me! Also there will be a new search for it! If it
is here the church will see that it does not go with
American renegades across the border!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, all the land speaks peace today, yet you are
as a threatening cloud over Soledad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak in warning, not threat,&ndash;&ndash;and I am not the
only cloud in the sky. The women of vengeance are
coming beyond there where the willows are green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta looked the way he pointed, and stood
up with an exclamation of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clodomiro! Call Clodomiro!&rdquo; she said hurriedly,
and as the priest only stared at her, she sped past him to
the portal and called the boy who came running from the
patio.</p>
<p>She pointed as the priest had pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are strangers, they do not know,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Kill a horse, but meet them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His horse was in the plaza, and he was in the saddle
before she finished speaking, digging in his heels and
yelling as though leading a charge while the frightened
animal ran like a wild thing.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta stood gazing after him intently, shading
her eyes with her hand. Women came running out of
the patio and Padre Andreas stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What new thing has given you fear?&rdquo; he asked in
wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new thing,&ndash;&ndash;a very old thing of which Elena told
me! That green strip of willow is the edge of a quicksand
where no one knows the depth. The women are
thinking to make a short path across, and the one who
leads will surely go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest stared incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How a quicksand and no water?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> water,&ndash;&ndash;hidden water! It comes under the
ground from the hills. In the old, old days it was a
wide well boiling like a kettle over a fire, also it was
warm! Then sand storms filled that valley and filled
the well. It is crusted over, but the boiling goes on far
below. Elena said not even a coyote will touch that
ca&ntilde;oncita though the dogs are on his trail. The Indians
say an evil spirit lives under there, but the women of
Mesa Blanca and Palomitas do not know the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should have a fence,&ndash;&ndash;a place like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had, but the wind took it, and, as you see, Soledad
is a forgotten place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched Clodomiro circle over the mesa trail
and follow the women down the slope of the little
valley. It was fully three miles away, yet the women
could be seen running in fear to the top of the mesa
where they cast themselves on the ground resting from
fright and exertion.</p>
<p>Quite enjoying his spectacular dash of rescue, Clodomiro
cantered back along the trail, and when he reached
the highest point, turned looking to the southeast where,
beyond the range, the old Yaqui trail led to the land of
despair.</p>
<p>He halted there, throwing up his hand as if in answer
to some signal, and then darted away, straight across the
mesa instead of toward the buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula has come!&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Jocasta in a hushed
voice of dread. &ldquo;She has come, and Se&ntilde;or Rhodes is
needed here. That coming of Tula may bring an end
to quiet days,&ndash;&ndash;like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed as she spoke, for the week had been as a
space of restful paradise after the mental and physical
horrors she had lived through.</p>
<p>In a half hour Clodomiro came in sight again just
as Kit rode in from the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get horses out of the corrals,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;all of
them. That trail has been long even from the railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done quickly, and the vaqueros rode out as
Clodomiro reached the plaza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tula?</i>&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula is as the living whose mind is with the dead,&rdquo;
said the boy. &ldquo;Many are sick, some are dead,&ndash;&ndash;the
mother of Tula died on the trail last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; whispered Kit. &ldquo;After all that hell
of a trail, to save no one for herself! Where is Marto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marto walks, and sick ones are on his horse. I
go back now that Tula has this horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will go. Stay you here to give help to the
women. Bring out beds in every corridor. Bring straw
and blankets when the beds are done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta put out her hand as he was about to
mount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I? What task is mine to help?&rdquo; she asked,
and Kit looked down at her gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, you have only to be yourself, gracious and
kind of heart. Also remember this is the first chance
in the lands of Soledad to show the natives they have
not alone a padrona, but a protecting friend. In days
to come it may be a memory of comfort to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he mounted, and led the string of horses out
to meet the exiles. While she looked after him murmuring,
&ldquo;In days to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the padre she said, &ldquo;I had ceased to think of
days to come, for the days of my life had reached the
end of all I could see or think. He gives hope even in
the midst of sadness,&ndash;&ndash;does the Americano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit met the band where the trail forked to Palomitas
and Mesa Blanca. Some wanted to go direct to their
own homes and people, while Marto argued that food
and rest and a priest awaited them at Soledad, and
because of their dead, they should have prayers.</p>
<p>Tula said nothing. She sat on the sand, and caressed
a knife with a slightly curved blade,&ndash;&ndash;a knife not Mexican,
yet familiar to Kit, and like a flash he recalled
seeing one like it in the hand of Conrad at Granados.</p>
<p>She did not even look up when he halted beside her
though the others welcomed with joy the sight of the
horses for the rest of the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula!&rdquo; he said bending over her, &ldquo;Tula, we come
to welcome you,&ndash;&ndash;my horse is for your riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up when he touched her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of me,&rdquo; she murmured wistfully, &ldquo;you made
me put a mark at that place after we met in the first
dawn,&ndash;&ndash;so I was knowing it well. Also my mother was
knowing,&ndash;&ndash;and it was where she died last night under
the moon. See, this is the knife on which Anita died in
that place. It is ended for us&ndash;&ndash;the people of Miguel,
and the people of Cajame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula, you have done wonderful things, many deeds
to make the spirit of Miguel proud. Is that not so, my
friends?&rdquo; and he turned to the others, travel-stained,
sick and weary, yet one in their cries of the gratitude
they owed to Tula and to him, by which he perceived
that Tula had, for her own reasons, credited him with
the plan of ransom.</p>
<p>They tried brokenly to tell of their long fear and
despair in the strangers&rsquo; land,&ndash;&ndash;and of sickness and
deaths there. Then the miracle of Tula walking by the
exalted excellencia of that great place, and naming one
by one the Palomitas names, forgetting none;&ndash;&ndash;until all
who lived were led out from that great planting place
of sugar cane and maize, and their feet set on the
northern way.</p>
<p>When they reached this joyous part of the recital
words failed, and they wept as they smiled at him and
touched the head of Tula tenderly. Even a gorgeous
and strange <i>manta</i> she now wore was pressed to the lips
of women who were soon to see their children or their
desolate mothers.</p>
<p>His eyes grew misty as they thronged about her,&ndash;&ndash;the
slender dark child of the breed of a leader. The new
<i>manta</i> was of yellow wool and cotton, bordered with
dull green and little squares of flaming scarlet woven
in it by patient Indian hands of the far south coast. It
made her look a bit royal in the midst of the drab-colored,
weary band.</p>
<p>She seemed scarcely to hear their praise, or their sobs
and prayers. Her face was still and her gaze far off
and brooding as her fingers stroked the curved blade
over and over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Indian stole that knife from the German after
his face was cut with it by her sister,&rdquo; said Marto
Cavayso quietly while the vaqueros were helping the
weaker refugees to mount, two to each animal. &ldquo;That
man gives it to her at the place where Marta, her
mother, died in the night. So after that she does not
sleep or eat or talk. It is as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see! Take you the others, and Tula will ride
on my saddle,&rdquo; said Kit in the same tone. Then he
pointed to the beautifully worked <i>manta</i>, &ldquo;Did she
squander wealth of hers on that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marto regarded him with an impatient frown&ndash;&ndash;it
seemed to him an ill moment for the American joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula had no wealth,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;we lived as we
could on the fine gold you gave to me for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I had forgotten that,&rdquo; declared Kit in some
wonder at this information, &ldquo;but <i>mantas</i> like that do
not grow on trees in Sonora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a gift from the very grand daughter of the
General Terain,&rdquo; said Marto. &ldquo;Also if you had seen
affairs as they moved there at Linda Vista you would
have said as does Ramon Rotil, that this one is daughter
of the devil! I was there, and with my eyes I saw it,
but if I had not,&ndash;&ndash;an angel from heaven would not make
me believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Virgin alone knows! for women are in her care,
and no man could see. As ordered, I went to the gates
of that hacienda very grand. <i>Sangre de Christo!</i> if
they had known they would have strung me to a tree
and filled me with lead! But I was the very responsible
vaquero of Rancho Soledad in Altar&ndash;&ndash;and the lizards of
guards at the gate had no moment of suspicion. I told
them the Indian girl carried a letter for the eyes of
their mistress and the sender was Do&ntilde;a Jocasta Perez.
At that they sent some messenger on the run, for they
say the Do&ntilde;a Dolores is fire and a sword to any servant
of theirs who is slow in her tasks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard she was a wonder of pride and beauty,&rdquo; said
Kit. &ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That came later. She sent for Tula who would
give the letter to no one,&ndash;&ndash;not even to me. The guard
divided their dinner with me while I waited; if they
were doing work for their general I was doing work
for mine and learned many things in that hour! At
last Tula came walking down that great stair made from
one garden to another where laurel trees grow, and with
her walked a woman out of the sun. There is no other
word, se&ntilde;or, for that woman! Truly she is of gold
and rose; her mother&rsquo;s family were of old Spain and
she is a glory to any day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you feel yourself under witchcraft&ndash;&ndash;once
more?&rdquo; queried Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sangre de Christo!</i> Never again! But Jos&eacute; Perez
had a good eye for making choice of women,&ndash;&ndash;that is a
true word! So Do&ntilde;a Dolores walked down to the drive
with that <i>manta</i> over her arm, also a belt in her hand,&ndash;&ndash;a
belt of gold, se&ntilde;or, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the astonished gaze of Kit Rhodes he drew from
under his coat the burro-skin belt he had directed the
making of up there in the hidden ca&ntilde;on of El Alisal.
Marto balanced it in his hand appreciatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was more of it than this!&rdquo; he exulted,
&ldquo;for the way on the railroad was paid out of it for all
the Indians. That is why we lost two days,&ndash;&ndash;our car
was put on a side track, and for the sick it was worse
than to walk the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores got in a fine carriage there. <i>Madre
de Dios!</i> what horses! White as snow on the sierras,
and gold on all the harness! Me, I am dreaming of
them since that hour! They got in, Tula also in her
poor dress, and a guard told me to follow the carriage.
It was as if San Gabriel made me invitation to enter
heaven! Twenty miles we went through that plantation,
a deep sea of cane, se&ntilde;or, and maize of a tree size,&ndash;&ndash;the
richness there is riches of a king. Guards were
everywhere and peons rode ahead to inform the major-domo,
and he came riding like devils to meet Do&ntilde;a
Dolores Terain. I am not a clever man, se&ntilde;or, but even
I could see that never before had the lady of Linda
Vista made herself fatigue by a plantation ride there,
and I think myself he had a scare that she see too much!
At the first when Do&ntilde;a Dolores had speech with him, it
was easy to see he blamed me, and his eyes looked once
as if to scorch me with fire. Then she pointed to the
child beside her, and gave some orders, and he sent a
guard with Tula through another gate into a great
corral where men and women were packed like cattle.
Se&ntilde;or, I have been in battles, but I never heard screams
of wounded like the screams of joy I heard in that
corral! Some of these Indians dropped like dead and
were carried out of the gate that way as Tula stood
inside and named the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it was over that woman of white beauty told
that manager to have them all well fed, and given meat
for the journey, for he would answer to the general
if any stroke of harm came to anyone of them on the
plantation of Linda Vista. Then she gave to my hand
the belt of gold to care for the poor people on the trail;&ndash;&ndash;also
she said the people were a free gift to Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
Perez, and there was no ransom to pay. Myself I think
the Do&ntilde;a Dolores had happiness to tell the general, her
father, that Jos&eacute; Perez had a wife, for that plan of
marriage was but for politics. <i>Sangre de Christo!</i> what
a woman! When all was done she held out the <i>manta</i> to
Tula, and her smile was as honey of the mesquite, and
she said, &rdquo;In my house you would not take the gift
I offered you, but now that you have your mother, and
your friends safe, will you yet be so proud?&ldquo; and Tula
with her arms around her mother, stood up and let the
thing be put over her head as you see, and that, Se&ntilde;or
Capitan, is the way of the strange <i>manta</i> of Tula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo; queried Kit, indicating the belt. Marto
smiled a bit sheepishly and lowered his voice because the
last of the horses were being loaded with the homesick
human freight, and the chatter, and clatter of hoofs had
ceased about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is the <i>manta</i>, and maybe I am a fool,&rdquo;
he confessed, &ldquo;but she told me to spend not one ounce
beyond what was needed, for it was to use only for
these sick and poor people of hers. There was a good
game going on in that train,&ndash;&ndash;and fools playing! I could
have won every peso if I had put up only a little handful
of the nuggets. That is why I think my general knew
when he said she was the devil, for she stood up in
that straight rich garment of honor and looked at me&ndash;&ndash;only
looked, not one spoken word, se&ntilde;or!&ndash;&ndash;and on my
soul and the soul of my mother, the wish to play in that
game went away from me in that minute, and did not
come back! How does a man account for a thing like
that; I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit thought of that first night on the treasure trail in
the mountain above them, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t account for it, though I do recognize the
fact,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is not the first time Tula has
ruled an outfit, and it is not the <i>manta</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he walked over and lifted her from the ground
as he would lift a child, she weighed so little more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;now that you are
rested, you will ride my horse to Soledad. Your big
work is done for your people. All is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&ndash;&ndash;not yet is the finish,&rdquo; she said shaking
her head, &ldquo;not yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit felt uncomfortably the weight in his pocket of
the key of Conrad&rsquo;s room. He had made most solemn
promise it would be guarded till she came. He had
studied up some logical arguments to present to her
attention for herding the German across the border as
a murderer the United States government would deal
justice to, but after the report of Marto concerning her
long trail, and the death of her mother in the desert, he
did not feel so much like either airing ideas or asking
questions. He was rather overwhelmed by the knowledge
that she had not allowed even Marto to guess that the
bag of gold was her very own!</p>
<p>He took her on the saddle in front of him because
she drooped so wearily there alone, and her head sank
against his shoulder as if momentarily she was glad
to be thus supported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little eaglet!&rdquo; he said affectionately, &ldquo;I will
take you north to Cap Pike, and someone else who
will love you when she hears all this; and in other years,
quieter years, we will ride again into Sonora, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head against his shoulder, and he
stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tula!&rdquo; he began in remonstrance, but she
lifted her hand with a curious gesture of finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of me,&rdquo; she said in a small voice with an
undertone of sad fatefulness, &ldquo;words do not come today.
They told you I am not sleeping on this home trail, and
it is true. I kept my mother alive long after the death
birds of the night were calling for her&ndash;&ndash;it is so! Also
today at the dawn the same birds called above me,&ndash;&ndash;above
<i>me</i>! and look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the summit of the valley&rsquo;s wall and
for a half mile ahead the others were to be seen on the
trail to Soledad, but it was not there she pointed, but to
the northeast where a dark cloud hung over the mountains.
Its darkness was cleft by one lance of lightning,
but it was too far away for sound of thunder to reach
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you not that the cloud in the sky is like a bird,&ndash;&ndash;a
dark angry bird? Also it is over the trail to the north,
but it is not for you,&ndash;&ndash;<i>I</i> am the one first to see it! Se&ntilde;or,
I will tell you, but I telling no other&ndash;&ndash;I think my
people are calling me all the time, in every way I look
now. I no knowing how I go to them, but&ndash;&ndash;I think I
go!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>EAGLE AND SERPENT</h3>
</div>
<p>Marto Cavayso gave to Kit Rhodes the burro-skin
belt and a letter from Do&ntilde;a Dolores Terain
to the wife of Jos&eacute; Perez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work is ended at the hacienda until the mules
come back for more guns, and I will take myself to the
adobe beyond the corrals for what rest there may be.
You are capitan under my general, so this goes to you
for the people of the girl he had a heart for. Myself,&ndash;&ndash;I
like little their coyote whines and yells. It may be a
giving of thanks, or it may be a mourning for dead,&ndash;&ndash;but
it sounds to me like an anthem made in hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He referred to the greeting songs of the returned
exiles, and the wails for the dead left behind on the trail.
The women newly come from Palomitas sat circled on
the plaza, and as food or drink was offered each, a portion
was poured on the sand as a libation to the ghosts
of the lately dead, and the name of each departed was
included in the wailing chant sung over and over.</p>
<p>It was a weird, hypnotic thing, made more so by the
curious light, yellow and green in the sky, preceding that
dark cloud coming slowly with sound of cannonading
from the north. Though the sun had not set, half the
sky was dark over the eastern sierras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The combination is enough to give even a sober man
the jim-jams,&rdquo; agreed Kit. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Jocasta is sick with
fear of them, and has gone in to pray as far from the
sound as possible. The letter will go to her, and the
belt will go to Tula who may thank you another day.
This day of the coming back she is not herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of God! that is a true word. No girl or
woman is like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest, who had talked with the sick and weary,
and listened to their sobs of the degradation of the slave
trail, had striven to speak with Tula, who with head
slightly drooped looked at him under her straight brows
as though listening to childish things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you!&rdquo; muttered Marto. &ldquo;That <i>manta</i> must
have been garb of some king&rsquo;s daughter, and no common
maid. It makes her a different thing. Would you not
think the padre some underling, and she a ruler giving
laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, seated as she was, in a chair with arms, her robe
of honor reached straight from her chin to her feet, giving
her appearance of greater height than she was possessed
of, and the slender banda holding her hair was of
the same scarlet of the broideries. Kit remembered calling
her a young Cleopatra even in her rags, and now he
knew she looked it!</p>
<p>He was not near enough to hear the words of the
priest, but with all his energy he was striving to win
her to some view of his. She listened in long silence
until he ceased.</p>
<p>Then her hand went under her <i>manta</i> and drew out
the curved knife.</p>
<p>She spoke one brief sentence, and lifted the blade over
her head. It caught the light of the hovering sun, and
the Indians near enough to hear her words set up a
scream of such unearthly emotion that the priest turned
ashen, and made the sign to ward off evil.</p>
<p>It was merely coincidence that a near flash of lightning
flamed from the heavens as she lifted the knife,&ndash;&ndash;but
it inspired every Indian to a crashing cry of exultation.</p>
<p>And it did not end there, for a Palomitas woman had
carried across the desert a small drum of dried skin
stretched over a hollow log, and at the words of Tula
she began a soft tum-tum-tum-tum on the hidden instrument.
The sound was at first as a far echo of the
thunder back of the dark cloud, and the voices of the
women shrilled their emphasis as the drum beat louder,
or the thunder came nearer.</p>
<p>Kit Rhodes decided Marto was entirely correct as to
the inspiration back of that anthem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sangre de Christo!</i> look at that!&rdquo; muttered Marto,
who meant to turn his back on the entire group, yet was
held by the fascination of the unexpected.</p>
<p>Four Indian youths with a huge and furious bull came
charging down the mesa towards the corral. A <i>reata</i>
fastened to each horn and hind foot of the animal was
about the saddle horn of a boy, and the raging bellowing
creature was held thus at safe distance from all. The
boys, shouting with their joy of victory, galloped past
the plaza to where four great stakes had already been
driven deep in the hard ground. To those stakes the
bull would be tied until the burden was ready for his
back&ndash;&ndash;and his burden would be what was left of
&ldquo;Judas&rdquo; when the women of the slave trail got through
with him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;God the father knows I am a man of no white
virtues,&rdquo; muttered Marto eyeing the red-eyed maddened
brute, &ldquo;but here is my vow to covet no comradeship of
aught in the shape of woman in the district of Altar&ndash;&ndash;bred
of the devil are they!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed after to the corral to watch the tying of
the creature, around which the Indian men were gathered
at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>But Rhodes, after one glance at the bellowing assistant
of Indian vengeance, found himself turning again
to Tula and the padre. That wild wail and the undertone
of the drum was getting horribly on his nerves,&ndash;&ndash;yet
he could not desert, as had Marto.</p>
<p>Tula sat as before, but with the knife held in her open
hand on the arm of the chair. She followed with a
grim smile the careering of the bull, then nodded her
head curtly to the priest and turned her gaze slowly
round the corridor until she saw Rhodes, and tilted back
her head in a little gesture of summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, little sister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on your
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padre asks to pray with El Aleman. I say yes,
for the padre has good thoughts in his heart,&ndash;&ndash;maybe
so! You have the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I have the key, but I fetch it back to you when
visitors start going in, and&ndash;&ndash;oh yes&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s your belt
for your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you be the one to give,&rdquo; she said with a glance
of sorrow towards a girl who was youngest of the slaves
brought back. &ldquo;You, amigo, keep all but the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Come along, padre, you
are to get the privilege you&rsquo;ve been begging for, and I
don&rsquo;t envy you the task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Padre Andreas made no reply. In his heart he blamed
Rhodes that the prisoner had not been let escape during
the absence of the girl, and also resented the offhand
manner of the young American concerning the duty of a
priest.</p>
<p>The sun was at the very edge of the world, and all
shadows spreading for the night when they went to the
door of Conrad&rsquo;s quarters. Kit unlocked the door and
looked in before opening wide. The one window faced
the corral, and Conrad turned from it in shaking horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it they say out there?&rdquo; he shouted in fury.
&ldquo;They call words of blasphemy, that the bull is Germany,
and &lsquo;Judas&rsquo; will ride it to the death! They are
wild barbarians, they are&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what they are,&rdquo; suggested Kit, &ldquo;here is
a priest who thinks you may have a soul worth praying
for, and the Indians have let him come&ndash;&ndash;once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he let the priest in and locked the door, going
back to Tula with the key. She sat where he had left
her, and was crooning again the weird tuneless dirge
at which Marto had been appalled.</p>
<p>But she handed him a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marto forgot. It was with the Chinaman trader
at the railroad,&rdquo; she said and went placidly on fondling
the key as she had fondled the knife, and pitching her
voice in that curious falsetto dear to Indian ceremonial.</p>
<p>He could scarce credit the letter as intended for himself,
as it was addressed in a straggling hand filling all
the envelope, to Capitan Christofero Rhodes, Manager
of Rancho Soledad, District of Altar, Sonora, Mexico,
and in one corner was written, &ldquo;By courtesy of Se&ntilde;or
Fidelio Lopez,&rdquo; and the date within a week. He opened
it, and walked out to the western end of the corridor
where the light was yet good, though through the barred
windows he could see candles already lit in the shadowy
<i>sala</i>.</p>
<p>The letter was from Cap Pike, and in the midst of all
the accumulated horror about him, Kit was conscious of
a great homesick leap of the heart as he skimmed the
page and found her name&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Billie is all right!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you, Capitan? (began the letter). That fellow
Fidelio rode into the <i>cantina</i> here at La Partida today. He
asked a hell&rsquo;s slew of questions about you, and Billie and me
nearly had fits, for we thought you were sure dead or held
for ransom, and I give it to you straight, Kit, there isn&rsquo;t a
peso left on the two ranches to ransom even Baby Buntin&rsquo; if
the little rat is still alive, and that ain&rsquo;t all Kit: it don&rsquo;t
seem possible that Conrad and Singleton mortgaged both
ranches clear up to the hilt, but it sure has happened, every
acre is plastered with ten per cent paper and the compound
interest strips it from Billie just as sure as if it was droppin&rsquo;
through to China. When Conrad was on the job he had it
all blanketed, but now saltpeter can&rsquo;t save it without cash.
Billie is all right, but some peaked with worry. So am I.
But you cheer up, for I got plans for a hike up into Pinal
County for us three on a search for the Lost Dutchman
Mine, lost fifty years and I have a hunch we can find it, got
the dope from an old half breed who knew the Dutchman.
So don&rsquo;t you worry about trailing home broke. The Fidelio
hombre said to look for you in six days after Easter, and
meet you with water at the Rio Seco, so we&rsquo;ll do that. He
called you capitan and said the Deliverer had made you an
officer; how about it? He let loose a line of talk about your
two women in the outfit, but I sort of stalled him on that,
so Billie wouldn&rsquo;t get it, for I reckon that&rsquo;s a greaser lie, Kit,
and you ain&rsquo;t hitched up to no gay Juanita down there. I
had a monkey and parrot time to explain even that Tula
squaw to Billie, for she didn&rsquo;t savvy&ndash;&ndash;not a copper cent&rsquo;s
worth! She is right here now instructin&rsquo; me, but I won&rsquo;t let
her read this, so don&rsquo;t you worry. She says to tell you it
looks at last like our old eagle bird will have a chance to flop
its wings in France. The pair of us is near about cross-eyed
from watchin&rsquo; the south trail into Altar, and the east trail
where the troops will go! She says even if we are broke
there is an adobe for you at Vijil&rsquo;s, and a range for Buntin&rsquo;
and Pardner. Billie rides Pardner now instead of Pat.</p>
<p>I reckon that&rsquo;s all Kit, and I&rsquo;ve worked up a cramp on this
anyway. I figured that maybe you laid low down there till
the Singleton murder was cleared up, but I can alibi you on
that O.&nbsp;K., when Johnny comes marchin&rsquo; home! So don&rsquo;t
you worry.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Yours truly,<span class='rindent11'>&nbsp;</span><br />
Pike.<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He read it over twice, seeking out the lines with <i>her</i>
name and dwelling on them. So Billie was riding Pardner,&ndash;&ndash;and
Billie had a camp ready for him,&ndash;&ndash;and Billie
couldn&rsquo;t savvy even a little Indian girl in his outfit&ndash;&ndash;<i>say!</i></p>
<p>He was smiling at that with a very warm glow in his
heart for the resentment of Billie. He could just imagine
Pike&rsquo;s monkey and parrot time trying to make
Billie understand accidents of the trail in Sonora. He
would make that all clear when he got back to God&rsquo;s
country! And the little heiress of Granados ranches
was only an owner of debt-laden acres,&ndash;&ndash;couldn&rsquo;t raise a
peso to ransom even the little burro! Well, he was
glad she rode Pardner instead of another horse; that
showed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then he smiled again, and drifted into dreams. He
would let Bunting travel light to the Rio Seco, and then
load him for her as no burro ever was loaded to cross
the border! He wondered if she&rsquo;d tell him again he
couldn&rsquo;t hold a foreman&rsquo;s job? He wondered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And then he felt a light touch on his arm, and turned
to see the starlike beauty of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta beside him.
Truly the companionship of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta might be a
more difficult thing to explain than that of the Indian
girl of a slave raid!</p>
<p>Her face was blanched with fear, and her touch
brought him back from his vision of God&rsquo;s country to the
tom-tom, and the weird chant, and the thunder of storm
coming nearer and nearer in the twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; she breathed in terror, &ldquo;even on my knees
in prayer it is not for anyone to shut out this music of
demons. Look! Yesterday she was a child of courage
and right, but what is she today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to Tula and clung to him, for in all the
wild chorus Tula was the leader,&ndash;&ndash;she who had the
words of ancient days from the dead Miguel. She sat
there as one enthroned draped in that gorgeous thing,
fit, as Marto said, for a king&rsquo;s daughter, while the others
sat in the plaza or rested on straw and blankets in the
corridor looking up at her and shrilling savage echoes to
the words she chanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that animal,&ndash;&ndash;I saw it!&rdquo; moaned Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.
&ldquo;Mother of God! that I should deny a priest who would
only offer prayers for that wicked one who is to be
tortured on it! Se&ntilde;or, for the love of God give me a
horse and let me go into the desert to that storm, any
place,&ndash;&ndash;any place out of sight and sound of this most
desolate house! The merciful God himself has forsaken
Soledad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke he realized that time had passed while
he read and re-read and dreamed a dream because of
the letter. The sun was far out of sight, only low hues
of yellow and blue melting into green to show the illumined
path it had taken. By refraction rays of copper
light reached the zenith and gave momentarily an unearthly
glow to the mesa and far desert, but it was only
as a belated flash, for the dusk of night touched the edge
of it.</p>
<p>And the priest locked in with Conrad had been forgotten
by him! At any moment that girl with the key
might give some signal for the ceremony, whatever it
was, of the death of the German beast!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, se&ntilde;ora, I promise you,&rdquo; he said soothingly,
patting her hand clinging to him. &ldquo;There is my horse
in the plaza, and there is Marto&rsquo;s. We will get the
padre, and both of you can ride to the little adobe
down the valley where Elena&rsquo;s old father lives. He is
Mexican, not Indian. It is better even to kneel in prayer
there all the night than to try to rest in Soledad while
this lasts. At the dawn I will surely go for you. Come,&ndash;&ndash;we
will ask for the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they approached Tula, whose eyes stared
straight out seeing none of the dark faces lifted to hers,
she seemed not to see Kit who stopped beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he said, touching her shoulder, &ldquo;the
padre waits to be let out of the room of El Aleman, and
the key is needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and held up the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be the one,&rdquo; begged Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
should do penance! I was not gentle in my words to the
padre, yet he is a man of God, and devoted. Let me be
the one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl looked up at that, and drew back the
key. Then some memory, perhaps that kneeling of
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta with the women of Palomitas, influenced
her to trust, and after a glance at Kit she nodded her
head and put the key in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, se&ntilde;or, have the horses,&rdquo; implored Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,
&ldquo;and I will at once come with Padre Andreas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pronto!</i>&rdquo; agreed Kit, &ldquo;but I must get you a <i>serape</i>.
Rain may fall from that cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed scarcely to hear him as she sped along the
patio towards the locked door. Kit entered his own
room for a blanket just as she fitted the key in the lock,
and spoke the padre&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The next instant he heard her screams, and a door
slam shut, and as he came out with the blanket, he saw
the priest dash toward the portal leading from the patio
to the plaza.</p>
<p>He ran to her, lifting her from the tiles where she
had been thrown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad!&rdquo; she cried pointing after the flying figure.
&ldquo;There! Quickly, se&ntilde;or, quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jerked open the door and looked within, a still
figure with the face hidden, crouched by a bench against
the wall. In two strides Kit crossed from the door and
grasped the shoulder, and the figure propped there fell
back on the tiles. It was the dead priest dressed in the
clothes of Conrad, and the horror of that which had
been a face showed he had died by strangulation under
the hands of the man for whom he had gone to pray.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta ran wildly screaming through the patio,
but the Indian voices and the drum prevented her from
being heard until she burst among them just as Conrad
leaped to the back of the nearest horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;El Aleman! El Aleman!&rdquo; she screamed pointing to
him in horror. &ldquo;He has murdered the padre and taken
his robe. It is El Aleman! Your Judas has killed your
priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit ran for his own horse, but with the quickness of
a cat Tula was before him in the saddle, and whirling
the animal, leaning low, and her gorgeous <i>manta</i> streaming
behind like a banner she sped after the German
screaming, &ldquo;Judas! Judas! Judas of Palomitas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as in the other chants led by her, the Indian
women took up this one in frenzied yells of rage.</p>
<p>The men of the corral heard and leaped to saddles to
follow the flying figures, but Kit was ahead,&ndash;&ndash;not much,
but enough to be nearest the girl.</p>
<p>Straight as an arrow the fugitive headed for Mesa
Blanca, the nearest ranch where a fresh horse could be
found, and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta and some of the women without
horses stood in the plaza peering after that wild race
in the gray of the coming night.</p>

<p class='caption'>
The Indian girl was steadily gaining on the German.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>A flash of lightning outlined the three ahead, and a
wail of utter terror went up from them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of God, the ca&ntilde;on of the quicksand!&rdquo; cried
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tula! Tula! Tula!&rdquo; shrilled the Indian women.</p>
<p>Tula was steadily gaining on the German, and Kit
was only a few rods behind as they dashed down the
slight incline to that too green belt in the floor of the
brown desert.</p>
<p>He heard someone, Marto he thought, shouting his
name and calling &ldquo;<i>Sumidero! Sumidero!</i>&rdquo; He did not
understand, and kept right on. Others were shouting at
Tula with as little result, the clatter of the horses and
the rumble of the breaking storm made all a formless
chaos of sound.</p>
<p>The frenzied scream of a horse came to him, and another
lightning flash showed Conrad, ghastly and staring,
leap from the saddle&ndash;&ndash;in the middle of the little
valley&ndash;&ndash;and Tula ride down on top of him!</p>
<p>Then a rope fell around Kit&rsquo;s shoulders, pinioning his
arms and he was jerked from the horse with a thud
that for a space stunned him into semi-unconsciousness,
but through it he heard again the pitiful scream of a
dumb animal, and shouts of Marto to the frenzied
Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Clodomiro, the <i>reata</i>! Wait for the lightning,
then over her shoulders! Only the horse is caught;&ndash;&ndash;steady
and a true hand, boy! Ai-yi! You are master,
and the Mother of God is your help! Run your horse
back,&ndash;&ndash;run, curse you! or she will sink as he sinks!
<i>Sangre de Christo!</i> she cuts the <i>reata</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit struggled out of the rope, and got to his feet in
time to see the flash of her knife as she whirled to her
victim. Again and again it descended as the man, now
submerged to the waist, caught her. His screams of
fear were curdling to the blood, but high above the German
voice of fear sounded the Indian voice of triumph,
and from the vengeful cry of &ldquo;Judas! Judas! Judas
of the world!&rdquo; her voice turned sharply to the high
clear chant Kit had heard in the hidden ca&ntilde;on of the
red gold. It was as she said&ndash;&ndash;there would be none of
her caste and clan to sing her death song to the waiting
ghosts, and she was singing it.</p>
<p>As those weird triumphant calls went out from the
place of death every Indian answered them with shouts as
of fealty, and in the darkness Kit felt as if among a
circle of wolves giving tongue in some signal not to
be understood by men.</p>
<p>He could hear the sobs of men and boys about him,
but not a measure of that wild wail failed to bring the
ever recurring response from the brown throats.</p>
<p>Marto, wet and trembling, cursed and prayed at the
horror of it, and moved close to Kit in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, Maria, and Jos&eacute;!&rdquo; he muttered in a choked
whisper, &ldquo;one would think the fathers of these devils
had never been christened! <i>Sangre de Christo!</i> look at
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For in a vivid sheet of lightning they saw a terrible
thing.</p>
<p>Tula, on the shoulders of the man, stood up for one
wavering instant and with both hands raised high, she
flung something far out from her where the sands were
firm for all but things of weight. Then her high triumphant
call ended sharply in the darkness as she cast
herself forward. She died as her sister had died, and
on the same knife.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta stumbled from a horse, and clung to Kit
in terror. &ldquo;Mother of God!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;It is as I
said! She is the Eagle of Mexico, and she died clean&ndash;&ndash;with
the Serpent under her feet!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In a dawn all silver and gold and rose after the storm,
there was only a trace at the edge of the sand where two
horses had carried riders to the treacherous smiling
arroya over which a coyote would not cross.</p>
<p>And one of the Indian women of Palomitas tied a
<i>reata</i> around the body of her baby son, and sent him to
creep out as a turtle creeps to that thing cast by Tula
to the women cheated of their Judas.</p>
<p>The slender naked boy went gleefully to the task as
to a new game, and spit in the dead face as he dragged
it with him to his mother who had pride in him.</p>
<p>It was kicked before the women back over the desert
to Soledad, and the boys used it for football that day,
and tied what was left of it between the horns of the
roped wild bull at the corral. The bellowing of the
bull when cut loose came as music to the again placid
Indian women of Palomitas. They were ready for the
home trail with their exiles. It had been a good ending,
and their great holiday at Soledad was over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>EACH TO HIS OWN</h3>
</div>
<p>A straggling train of pack mules followed by
a six-mule wagon, trailed past Yaqui Springs ten
days later, and was met there by the faithful Chappo and
two villainous looking comrades, who had cleaned out
the water holes and stood guard over them until arrival
of the ammunition train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For beyond is a dry hell for us, and on the other
side the Deliverer is circled by enemy fighters who would
trap him in his own land. He lies hid like a fox in the
hills waiting for this you bring. Water must not fail,
and mules must not fail; for that am I here to give
the word for haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even forty mule loads will not serve him long,&rdquo;
said Kit doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a fox in the hills I tell you, Se&ntilde;or Capitan,&ndash;&ndash;and
only one way into the den! Beyond the enemy he
has other supplies safe&ndash;&ndash;this is to fight his way to it.
After that he will go like a blaze through dry meadows
of zacatan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit would have made camp there for the night, but
Chappo protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or! Every drop in the sand here is for the
mules of the army. It is not my word, it is the word of
my general. Four hours north you will find Little
Coyote well. One day more and at the crossing of Rio
Seco, water will be waiting from the cold wells of La
Partida. It is so arrange, se&ntilde;or, and the safe trail is
made for you and for excellencia, the se&ntilde;ora. In God&rsquo;s
name, take all your own, and go in peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the se&ntilde;ora is weary to death, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Capitan,&rdquo; spoke Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, who
drooped in the saddle like a wilted flower. &ldquo;But the
se&ntilde;ora will not die, and if she does it is not so much
loss as the smallest of the soldiers of El Gavilan. We
will go on, and go quickly, see!&ndash;&ndash;there is yet water in
the cantin, and four hours of trail is soon over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ugly Chappo came shyly forward and, uncovered,
touched the hem of her skirt to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The high heart of the excellencia gives life to the
men who fight,&rdquo; he said and thrust his hand in a pocket
fastened to his belt. &ldquo;This is to you from the Deliverer,
se&ntilde;ora. His message is that it brought to him
the lucky trail, and he would wish the same to the
Do&ntilde;a Jocasta Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little cross, once sent back to her by a peon
in bitterness of soul, and now sent by a general of
Mexico with the blessing of a soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him Jocasta takes it as a gift of God, and his
name is in her prayers,&rdquo; she said and turned away.</p>
<p>Clodomiro pushed forward,&ndash;&ndash;a very different Clodomiro,
for the fluttering bands of color were gone from
his arms and his hair&ndash;&ndash;the heart of the would-be bridegroom
was no longer his. He was stripped as for the
trail or for war, and fastened to his saddle was the
gun and ammunition he had won from Cavayso who
had gone quickly onward with his detachment of the
pack.</p>
<p>But Clodomiro halted beside Chappo, regardless of
need for haste on the trail, and asked him things in that
subdued Indian tone without light, shade, or accent,
in which the brown brothers of the desert veil their
intimate discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, beyond!&rdquo; said Chappo, &ldquo;two looks on the
trail,&rdquo; and he pointed west. &ldquo;Two looks and one water
hole, and if wind moves the sand no one can find the
way where we go. It is not a trail for boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not now a boy,&rdquo; said Clodomiro, &ldquo;and when
the safety trail of the se&ntilde;ora is over&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Chappo waved him onward, for the wagon and
the pack mules, and even little gray Bunting had turned
reluctant feet north.</p>
<p>Clodomiro had come from Soledad because Elena,&ndash;&ndash;who
never had been out of sight of the old adobe walls,&ndash;&ndash;sat
on the ground wailing at thought of leaving her old
sick father and going to war, for despite all the persuasions
of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, Elena knew what she knew,
and did not at all believe that any of them would see
the lands of the Americano,&ndash;&ndash;not with pack mules of
Ramon Rotil laden with guns!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Tula had lived, no other would have been asked,&rdquo;
Rhodes had stated. &ldquo;But one is needed to make camp
for the se&ntilde;ora on the trail,&ndash;&ndash;and to me the work of the
packs and the animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can do,&rdquo; Clodomiro offered. &ldquo;My thought
was to go where Tula said lovers of hers must go, and
that was to El Gavilan. But this different thing can
also be my work to the safe wells of the American. That
far I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the three turned north from the war trail, and
Clodomiro followed, after making a prayer that the
desert wind would hear, and be very still, and fill no
track made by the mules with the ammunition.</p>
<p>This slight discussion at the parting of the ways concerning
two definite things,&ndash;&ndash;need of haste, and conserving
of water,&ndash;&ndash;left no moment for thought or query of
the packs of furnishings deemed of use to Se&ntilde;ora Perez
in her removal to the north.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta herself had asked no question and taken
no interest in them. Stripped of all sign of wealth and
in chains, she had ridden into Soledad, and in comfort
and much courtesy she was being conducted elsewhere.
How long it might endure she did not know, and no
power of hers could change the fact that she had been
made wife of Jos&eacute; Perez;&ndash;&ndash;and at any turn of any road
luck might again be with his wishes, and her estate fall
to any level he choose to enforce.</p>
<p>At dusk they reached the Little Coyote well, and had
joy to find water for night and morning, and greasewood
and dead mesquite wood for a fire. The night had
turned chill and Clodomiro spread the <i>serape</i> of Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta over a heap of flowering greasewood branches.
It was very quiet compared with the other camps on
the trail, and had a restful air of comfort, and of that
Jocasta spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always the fear is here, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said touching her
breast. &ldquo;All the men and guns of Ramon Rotil did not
make that fear go quiet. Every ca&ntilde;on we crossed I was
holding my breath for fear of hidden men of Jos&eacute; Perez!
You did not see him in the land where he is strong; but
men of power are bound to him there in the south, and&ndash;&ndash;against
one woman&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, I do not think you have read the papers
given to you by Padre Andreas to put with the others
given by General Rotil,&rdquo; was Kit&rsquo;s quiet comment. He
glanced toward the well where the boy was dipping water
into a wicker bottle. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, it is my permit to be passed safely by all
the men of Ramon Rotil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That I have not
had need of. Also there is the record that the American
murder at Granados was the crime of Conrad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;ora, there is one other paper among them.&ndash;&ndash;I
would have told you yesterday if I had known your
fear. I meant to wait until the trail was ended, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; she breathed leaning toward him, her great
eyes glowing with dreadful question, &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the paper, for I signed it,&rdquo; said Kit staring
in the leaping blaze. &ldquo;So did the padre. It is the certificate
of the burial of Jos&eacute; Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or! <i>Madre de Dios!</i>&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death reached him on his own land, se&ntilde;ora. We
passed the grave the first day of the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face went very white as she made the sign of
the cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&ndash;&ndash;Ramon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&ndash;&ndash;the general did not see Perez on the trail. He
tried to escape from Cavayso and the man sent a bullet
to stop him. It was the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered and covered her eyes.</p>
<p>Kit got up and walked away. He looked back from
where he tethered the mules for the night, but she had
not moved. The little crucifix was in her hand, he thought
she was praying. There were no more words to be said,
and he did not go near her again that night. He sent
Clodomiro with her <i>serape</i> and pillow, and when the
fire died down to glowing ash, she arose and went to
the couch prepared. She went without glance to right
or left&ndash;&ndash;the great fear had taken itself away!</p>
<p>Clodomiro rolled himself in a <i>serape</i> not far from
her place of rest, but Kit Rhodes slept with the packs
and with two guns beside him. From the start on the
trail no man had touched his outfit but himself. He
grinned sometimes at thought of the favorable report
the men of Rotil would deliver to their chief,&ndash;&ndash;for the
Americano had taken all personal care of the packs and
chests of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta! He was as an owl and had no
human need of sleep, and let no man help him.</p>
<p>The trail to the ca&ntilde;on of the Rio Seco was a hard
trail, and a long day, and night caught them ere they
reached the rim of the dry wash where, at long intervals,
rain from the hills swept down its age-old channel for
a brief hour.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, for the first time, had left the saddle and
crept to the rude couch afforded by the piled-up blankets
in the wagon; Clodomiro drove; and Kit, with the mules,
led the way.</p>
<p>A little water still swished about in their water bottles,
but not enough for the mules. He was more anxious than
he dared betray, for it was twenty miles to the lower
well of La Partida, and if by any stroke of fortune Cap
Pike had failed to make good&ndash;&ndash;Cap was old, and liable
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then through the dusk of night he heard, quite near
in the trail ahead, a curious thing, the call of a bird&ndash;&ndash;and
not a night bird!</p>
<p>It was a tremulous little call, and sent a thrill of such
wild joy through his heart that he drew back the mule
with a sharp cruel jerk, and held his breath to listen.
Was he going <i>loco</i> from lack of sleep,&ndash;&ndash;lack of water,&ndash;&ndash;and
dreams of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>It came again, and he answered it as he plunged forward
down a barranca and up the other side where a
girl sat on a roan horse under the stars:&ndash;&ndash;his horse! also
his girl!</p>
<p>If he had entertained any doubts concerning the
last&ndash;&ndash;but he knew now he never had; a rather surprising
fact considering that no word had ever been spoken
of such ownership!&ndash;&ndash;they would have been dispelled by
the way she slipped from the saddle into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and you didn&rsquo;t forget! you didn&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; she
whimpered with her head hidden against his breast.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m mighty glad of that. Neither did I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lark-child, you&rsquo;ve been right alongside wherever
I heard that call ever since I rode away,&rdquo; he said
patting her head and holding her close. He had a horrible
suspicion that she was crying,&ndash;&ndash;girls were mysterious!
&ldquo;Now, now, now,&rdquo; he went on with a comforting
pat to each word, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about anything.
I&rsquo;m back safe, though in big need of a drink,&ndash;&ndash;and luck
will come your way, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tilted her cantin to him, and began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it has come my way!&rdquo; she exulted. &ldquo;O Kit,
I can&rsquo;t keep it a minute, Kit&ndash;&ndash;we did find that sheepskin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? A sheepskin?&rdquo; He had no recollection of a
lost sheepskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cap Pike and I! In the bottom of an old chest
of daddy&rsquo;s! We&rsquo;re all but crazy because it came just
when we were planning to give up the ranch if we had
to, and now that you are here&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; her sentence ended
in a happy sigh of utter content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, now that I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he assented amicably,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stop all that moving business&ndash;&ndash;<i>pronto</i>. That is
if we live to get to water. What do you know about
any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two barrels waiting for you, and Cap rustling firewood,
but I heard the wagon, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he assented again. &ldquo;Into the saddle with you
and we&rsquo;ll get there. The folks are all right, but the
cayuses&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light began to blaze on the level above, and the
mules, smelling water, broke into a momentary trot and
were herded ahead of the two who followed more slowly,
and very close together.</p>
<p>Cap Pike left the fire to stand guard over the water
barrels and shoo the mules away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; he called waving his hat in
salute. &ldquo;The patriots of Sonora have nothing on you
when it comes to making collections on their native heath!
I left you a poor devil with a runt of a burro, a cripple,
and an Indian kid, and you&rsquo;ve bloomed out into a bloated
aristocrat with a batch of high-class army mules. And
say, you&rsquo;re just in time, and you don&rsquo;t know it! We&rsquo;re
in at last, by Je-rusalem, we&rsquo;re <i>in</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit grinned at him appreciatively, but was too busy
getting water to ask questions. The wagon was rattling
through the dry river bed and would arrive in a few
minutes, and the first mules had to be got out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; said Billie alongside of him. &ldquo;He
means war. We&rsquo;re in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Mexico? <i>Again?</i>&rdquo; smiled Kit skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;something real&ndash;&ndash;helping France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he protested with radiant eyes. &ldquo;Me for it!
Say, children, this is some homecoming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three shook hands, all talking at once, and Kit
and Billie forgot to let go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know Cap swore an alibi for you
against that suspicion Conrad tried to head your way,&rdquo;
she stated a bit anxiously. &ldquo;You stayed away so long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Lark-child,&rdquo; he said reassuringly, &ldquo;I know
all that, and a lot more. I&rsquo;ve brought letters of introduction
for the government to some of Conrad&rsquo;s useful
pacifist friends along the border. Don&rsquo;t you fret, Billie
boy; the spoke we put in their wheel will overturn their
applecart! The only thing worrying me just now,&ndash;&ndash;beautifullest!&ndash;&ndash;is
whether you&rsquo;ll wait for me till I enlist,
get to France, do my stunt to help clean out the brown
rats of the world, and come back home to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yip-pee!&rdquo; shrilled Pike who was slicing bacon into
a skillet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a line now on how you made your
other collections!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie laughed and looked up at him a bit shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited for you before without asking, and I reckon
I can do it again! I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m wonderfully happy&ndash;&ndash;for
I didn&rsquo;t want you to worry over coming home broke&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisper, Lark-child. <i>I&rsquo;m not!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisper, I said,&rdquo; and he put one hand over her
mouth and led her over to the little gray burro. &ldquo;Now,
not even to Pike until we get home, Billie,&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;ve come
out alive with the goods, while every other soul who knew
went &lsquo;over the range&rsquo;! Buntin&rsquo; carries your share. I
knew you were sure to find the sheepskin map sooner or
later,&rdquo; he lied glibly, &ldquo;but luck didn&rsquo;t favor me hanging
around for it. I had to get it while the getting was
good, but we three are partners for keeps, Buntin&rsquo; is
yours, and I&rsquo;ll divide with Pike out of the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie touched the pack, tried to lift it, and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy, Kit Rhodes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad you&rsquo;ve picked a crazy man to marry!&rdquo; he
laughed, and took off the pack. &ldquo;Seventy-five pounds
in that. I&rsquo;ve over three hundred. Lark-child, if you
remember the worth of gold per ounce, I reckon you&rsquo;ll see
that there won&rsquo;t need to be any delay in clearing off the
ranch debts,&ndash;&ndash;not such as you would notice! and maybe
I might qualify as a ranch hand when I come back,&ndash;&ndash;even
if I couldn&rsquo;t hold the job the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Kit! O Cap! O me!&rdquo; she whispered chantingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare wake me up, for I&rsquo;m having the dream
of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he caught her, drew her close and kissed her hair
rumpled in the desert wind.</p>
<p>And as the wagon drew into the circle of light, that
was the picture Do&ntilde;a Jocasta saw from the shadows of
the covered wagon:&ndash;&ndash;young love, radiant and unashamed!</p>
<p>She stared at them a moment strangely in a sudden
mist of tears, as Clodomiro jumped down and arranged
for her to alight. Cap Pike looking up, all but dropped
the coffeepot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some little collector&ndash;&ndash;that boy!&rdquo; he muttered, and
then aloud, &ldquo;You <i>Kit</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit turned and came forward leading Billie, who suddenly
developed panic at vision of the most beautiful,
tragic face she had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some collector!&rdquo; murmured Cap Pike forgetting
culinary operations to stare. &ldquo;Shades of Sheba&rsquo;s
queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kit, whose days and nights of Mesa Blanca and
Soledad had rather unfitted him for hasty adjustments
to conventions, or standardized suspicion regarding the
predatory male, held the little hand of Billie very tightly,
and did not notice her gasp of amazement. He went forward
to assist Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, whose hesitating half glance
about her only enhanced the wonder of jewel-green eyes
whose beauty had been theme of many a Mexic ballad.</p>
<p>For these were the first Americanos she had ever met,
and it was said in the south that Americanos might be
wild barbaros,&ndash;&ndash;though the se&ntilde;or of the songs&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The se&ntilde;or of the songs reached his hand and made his
best bow as he noted her sudden shrinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, are friends of good heart. We
are now on the edge of the lands of La Partida, and this
little lady is its padrona waiting to give you welcome at
the border. Folks, this is Se&ntilde;ora Perez who has escaped
from hell by help of the guns of El Gavilan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Jocasta!&rdquo; repeated Cap Pike standing in
amazed incredulity with the forgotten skillet at an awkward
angle dripping grease into the camp fire, but his
amazement regarding personality did not at all change
his mental attitude as to the probable social situation.
&ldquo;Some collector, Brother, but hell in Sonora isn&rsquo;t the
only hell you can blaze the trail to with the wrong combination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit turned a silencing frown on the philosopher of
the skillet, but Billie went toward the guest with outstretching
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, oh!&rdquo; she breathed as if one of her
fairy tales of beauty had come true, and then in Spanish
she added the sweet gracious old Castillian welcome,
&ldquo;Be at home with us on your own estate, Se&ntilde;ora Perez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocasta laid her hands on the shoulder of the girl, and
looked in the clear gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Spanish, Se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandmother was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the Mother of God that you are not a
strange Americana!&rdquo; sighed Jocasta in sudden relief.
Then she turned to her American courier and guard and
salvation over the desert trails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; she said briefly. &ldquo;She is as the young sister
of me who&ndash;&ndash;who is gone to God! Make yourself her
guard forever, Don Pajarito. May you sing many songs
together, and have no sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the substantial supper, Kit heard at first hand
all the veiled suspicion against himself as voiced in the
fragment of old newspaper wrapped around Fidelio&rsquo;s
tobacco, and he and Do&ntilde;a Jocasta spread out the records
written by the padre, and signed by Jocasta and the
others, as witness of how Philip Singleton met death in
the arroya of the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all here in this paper,&rdquo; said Jocasta, &ldquo;and that
is best. I can tell the alcalde, yes, but if an&ndash;&ndash;an accident
had come to me on the trail, the words on the paper
would be the safer thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fear on the trail is gone for you now,&rdquo; said
Kit smiling at her across the camp fire. Neither of them
had said any word of life at Mesa Blanca or Soledad, or
of the work of Tula at the death.</p>
<p>The German had strangled a priest, and escaped, and
in ignorance of trails had ridden into a quicksand, and
that was all the outer world need know of his end!</p>
<p>The fascinated eyes of Billie dwelt on Jocasta with
endless wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came north with the guns and soldiers of
Ramon Rotil,&ndash;&ndash;how wonderful!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;And
if the newspapers tell the truth I reckon he needs the
guns all right! Cap dear, where is that one Jos&eacute; Ortego
rode in with from the railroad as we were leaving La
Partida?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my coat, Honey. You go get it&ndash;&ndash;you are younger
than this old-timer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jocasta followed Billie with her eyes, though she had
not understood the English words between them. It was
not until the paper was unfolded with an old and very bad
photograph of Ramon Rotil staring from the front page
that she whispered a prayer and reached out her hand.
The headline to the article was only three words in heavy
type across the page: &ldquo;Trapped at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the words escaped her, and that picture of him
in the old days with the sombrero of a peon on his
head and his audacious eyes smiling at the world held
her. No picture of him had ever before come her way;
strange that it should be waiting for her there at the
border!</p>
<p>The Indian boy at sight of it, stepped nearer, and
stood a few paces from her, looking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It calls,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had spoken except to make
reply since entering the American camp. Do&ntilde;a Jocasta
frowned at him and he moved a little apart, leaning,&ndash;&ndash;a
slender dark, semi-nude figure, against the green and
yellow mist of a palo verde tree,&ndash;&ndash;listening with downcast
eyes.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Jocasta looked from the pictured face to the big
black letters above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a victorious battle, for him?&rdquo; she asked and
Kit hesitated to make reply, but Billie, not knowing
reason for silence, blurted out the truth even while her
eyes were occupied by another column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, se&ntilde;ora. But here is something of real
interest to you, something of Soledad&ndash;&ndash;oh, I <i>am</i>
sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it say,&ndash;&ndash;Soledad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&ndash;&ndash;I forgot you don&rsquo;t know the English!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Troops from the south to rescue Don Jos&eacute; Perez from
El Gavilan at Soledad turn guns on that survival of old mission
days, and level it to the ground. Soledad was suspected
as an ammunition magazine for the bandit chief, and it
is feared Se&ntilde;or Perez is held in the mountains for ransom,
as no trace of him has been found.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; remarked Kit, and Billie turned
beseeching eyes on the owner of Soledad, and repeated
miserably&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I <i>am</i> so sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Do&ntilde;a Jocasta only lifted her head with a certain
disdain, and veiled the emerald eyes slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; she murmured with a shrug of the shoulder.
&ldquo;It is then a bandit he is called in the words of the
American newspaper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap Pike not comprehending the rapid musical
Spanish, leaned forward fishing for a coal to light his
pipe, noting her voice and watching her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have it already!&rdquo; he muttered to Kit.
&ldquo;All velvet, and mad as hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie, much bewildered, turned to Kit as for help, but
the slender hand of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta reached out pointing
to the headlines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;this?&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;It is, you say, not
victorious for Ramon Rotil, that&ndash;&ndash;bandit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; hesitated Billie, &ldquo;that he is hid
in the hills, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we know,&rdquo; stated Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, &ldquo;what other
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He has a wound and was carried by his men to one
of his retreats, a hidden place,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Billie slowly, translating
into Spanish as she went on. &ldquo;That is all except
that the Federals had to retreat temporarily because a
storm caused trouble and washed out a bridge over which
their ammunition train has to go. The place of the accident
is very bad. Timber and construction engineers
are being rushed to service there, but for a few days
luck is with the Hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&ndash;&ndash;For a few days!&rdquo; repeated Do&ntilde;a Jocasta in
the cool sweet voice. &ldquo;In a few days Ramon Rotil
could cross Mexico. He is El Gavilan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things were coming too fast for Billie. She regarded
the serenity of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta with amazement, and tried to
imagine how she would feel if enemy guns battered down
the old walls of Granados, or&ndash;&ndash;thought of terror&ndash;&ndash;if
Kit should be held in the hills and tortured for ransom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of floods,&rdquo; remarked Pike in amiable desire
to bridge over an awkward pause, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve used half the
water we brought, and need to make a bright and early
start tomorrow. Rio Seco is no garden spot to get
caught in short of water. Our La Partida mules are
fresh as daisies right off a month of range, but yours
sure look as if they had made the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say,&ndash;&ndash;the old se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; asked Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta.</p>
<p>Billie translated for her, whereupon she arose and
summoned Clodomiro by a gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bed,&rdquo; she said briefly, &ldquo;over there,&rdquo; and she
indicated a thicket of greasewood the wagon had passed
on their arrival. &ldquo;Also this first night of safety you
will be the sentinel to keep guard that Se&ntilde;or Rhodes may
at last have sleep. All the danger trail he had none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap Pike protested that he do guard duty, but the
smile of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta won her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is younger and not weary, se&ntilde;or. It is good for
him, and it pleases me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp is yours,&rdquo; he agreed weakly, and against
his better judgment. He did not like Indians who were
like &ldquo;sulky slim brown dumb snakes&rdquo;; that was what
he muttered when he looked at Clodomiro. In his irritation
at the Indian&rsquo;s silence it didn&rsquo;t even occur to him
that he never had known any snakes but dumb ones.</p>
<p>But if the voice of Clodomiro was uncannily silent,
his eyes spoke for him as they followed Do&ntilde;a Jocasta.
Kit could only think of a lost, homesick dog begging for
the scent of the trail to his own kennel. He said so to
Billie as he made her bed in the camp wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap and I will be right here at the hind wheels,&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;sure, I&rsquo;ll let the Indian ride herd for
the night. Do&ntilde;a Jocasta is right, it&rsquo;s his turn, and we
seem to have passed the danger line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock wood!&rdquo; cautioned Billie.</p>
<p>So he rapped his head with his knuckles, and they
laughed together as young happy things do at trifles.
Then he stretched himself for sleep under the stars and
almost within arm&rsquo;s reach of the girl&ndash;&ndash;the girl who
had ridden to meet him in the night, the wonderful girl
who had promised to wait until he came back from
France ... of course he could get into the army
<i>now</i>! They would need men too badly to turn him
down again. If there was a trifle of discrepancy in sight
of his eyes&ndash;&ndash;which he didn&rsquo;t at all believe&ndash;&ndash;he had
the dust now, also the nuggets, to buy any and all treatment
to adjust <i>that</i> little matter. He had nearly four
hundred pounds, aside from giving all he dared give at
once as Tula&rsquo;s gift to those women of the slave raid.
After the war was over he would find ways of again
crossing over to the great treasure chest in the hidden
ca&ntilde;on. The little information Pike had managed to
convey to him about that sheepskin map told him that
the most important indications had been destroyed during
those years it had been buried for safe-keeping.
The only true map in existence was the one in his own
memory,&ndash;&ndash;no use to tell Pike and Billie that! He could
leave them in comfort and content, and when he got
back from France&ndash;&ndash;He wondered how long it would
last&ndash;&ndash;the war. Hadn&rsquo;t the greatest of Americans tried
three years ago to hammer the fact into the alleged
brain pans of the practical politicians that the sooner
the little old United States made guns, and ships, and
flying machines for <i>herself</i>, the sooner she could help end
that upheaval of hell in Europe?... and they
wouldn&rsquo;t listen! Listen?&ndash;&ndash;They brought every ounce
of influence they could round up to silence those facts,&ndash;&ndash;the
eternally condemned ostriches sticking their own heads
in the sand to blind the world to the situation! Now they
were in, and he wondered if they had even ten rounds
of ammunition for the cartridge belts of the few trained
soldiers in service? They had not had even three rounds
for the showy grand review attempted in Texas not
long since; also the transportation had been a joke, some
of the National Guards started, but never did arrive&ndash;&ndash;and
France was a longer trail than Texas. God! they
should be ready to fight as the French were ready, in
twelve hours&ndash;&ndash;and it would have to be months&ndash;&ndash;a
long unequal hell for a time over there, but only one
finish, and the brown rats driven back to their den!
After that the most wonderful girl would&ndash;&ndash;would&ndash;&ndash;would&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then all the sleep due him on the sleepless trail settled
over him like a net weighted, yet very caressing, and
the world war and the wonderful girl drifted far away!</p>
<p>Beyond, on the other side of the fire, and out of the
circle of light, Clodomiro bore the <i>serape</i> of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta,
and made clear the place for her couch. She had
returned to the light of the fire and was scanning again
the annoying paper of the Americanos. Especially that
remembered face of the audacious eyes. They were
different eyes in these latter days, level and cynical, and
sometimes cruel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He calls,&rdquo; said Clodomiro again beside her. She had
not heard him, and turned in anger that he dare startle
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does he call?&rdquo; she asked irritably tossing aside
the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Mexico, I think. All Mexico&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; and he
touched his breast. &ldquo;Me, I do not sleep. I do your
work and when the end of the trail is yours, I ask, Excellencia,
that you send me back that I find him again,&ndash;&ndash;the
Deliverer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Ramon Rotil ever do for you that you fret
like a chained coyote because his enemies are strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not anything, Excellencia. Me, he would not know
if I told him my name, but&ndash;&ndash;he is the Deliverer who will
help the clans. Also, <i>she</i> would go,&ndash;&ndash;Tula. <i>Sangre de
Christo!</i> there would be no chain strong enough to hold
her back if his wounds cried for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&ndash;&ndash;his wounds cried for help!&rdquo; repeated Do&ntilde;a
Jocasta mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, Excellencia, El Gavilan was giving help
to many people in the lands he crossed. Now the many
will forget, and like a hawk with the weight of an arrow
in his breast he will fly alone to a high nest of the hills.
Death will nest with him there some night or some day,
Excellencia. And the many will forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet you!&rdquo; ordered Do&ntilde;a Jocasta angrily.</p>
<p>Abashed, Clodomiro went silent, and with a murmured
apology took himself into the shadows.</p>
<p>She lifted the pictured face barely discernible now in
the diminished light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;the many will forget!&rdquo; she repeated irritably.
&ldquo;The boy has the truth of it, but if <i>she</i> had lived, so terribly
wicked,&ndash;&ndash;so lost of God, I wonder if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her face looking up at the still stars as if for
light on a thought, then flung her hands out despairingly
and turned away to the couch by the green bush of
fragrant yellow bloom.</p>
<p>But not to sleep. Long after the Americanos were
wrapped in slumber a little blaze sent glimmer of light
through the undergrowth, and she saw Clodomiro
stretched beside the fire. He had tossed a bit of greasewood
on the coals that he might again study the face of
El Gavilan.</p>
<p>She had heard him say that if no desert wind lifted
the sand he could follow to that hidden nest of the Hawk.
It was very dark now except for glimmer of stars through
lacy, slow-drifting clouds,&ndash;&ndash;there was no wind. Later
there would be a waning moon! Much of every waking
life is a dream, and her dreams were of the No Man&rsquo;s
Land of the desert,&ndash;&ndash;the waterless trail from which she
had been rescued for peace!</p>
<p>Twice during the night Kit roused from the depths
sufficiently to realize that sleep is one of the greatest
gifts to man. Once Clodomiro was stretched by the little
fire inspecting the paper he could not read, the second
time he thought Baby Bunting was nosing around trying
to get close to human things. Both times he reached out
his hands to the precious packs beside which he slept
on the trail. All were safe, and he drifted again into a
great ocean of slumber.</p>
<p>He was wakened at dawn by the voice of Cap Pike,
keyed high for an ultra display of profanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the jumping Je-hosophat, I knew it!&rdquo; he shrilled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your latest collection, begod! I hoped he
wouldn&rsquo;t, and knew he would! The all-firedest finest
pair of mules on Granados, and every water bag in
the outfit! Can you beat it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first shout Kit jumped to his feet, his eyes
running rapidly over his pack saddle outfit. All was
safe there, and as Billie lifted her head and looked at him
drowsily over the edge of the wagon bed he realized
that in the vital things of life all was well with his world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Sheba run your camp, and run it to hell, will
you?&rdquo; went on Cap Pike accusingly. He was thrashing
around among the growth back of the Soledad outfit
wagon where the mules had been tethered. &ldquo;Two&ndash;&ndash;four&ndash;&ndash;six,
and Baby Buntin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;yes sir! Lit out by
the dark of the moon, and left neither hide nor hair,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be reasonable, Cap!&rdquo; protested Kit. &ldquo;Buntin&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t gone&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s right alongside here, waiting for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shoutin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s here; so is every dragged-to-death
skate you hit camp with! It&rsquo;s Billie&rsquo;s crackerjack
mules, the pick of the ranch, that the bare-legged greasy
heathen hit the trail with! And every water bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Kit, verifying the water statement by
a glance at the barrels, &ldquo;no one is to blame. The boy
didn&rsquo;t want to come this trail. He stuck until we were
over the rough of it, and then he cut loose. A pair of
mules isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, of course not!&rdquo; agreed Cap sarcastically. &ldquo;A
mere A-number-one pair of mules belonging to another
fellow is only a flea bite to offer a visitor for supper!
Well, all <i>I</i> got to say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Cap dear,&rdquo; suggested Billie. &ldquo;The Indian
was here because of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta, and <i>she</i> can&rsquo;t
help it! As she doesn&rsquo;t understand English, she&rsquo;ll probably
think you&rsquo;re murdering some of us over here. Whist
now, and put your muzzle on! We&rsquo;ll get home without
the two mules. I&rsquo;ll go and tell her that the hysterics is
your way of offering morning prayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped away, laughing at his protests, but when
a little past the fire place she halted, standing very still,
peering beyond at something on the ground under the
greasewood where the <i>serape</i> of Do&ntilde;a Jocasta had been
spread. No <i>serape</i> or sleeper was there!</p>
<p>Kit noted her startled pause, and in a few strides was
beside her; then, without a word, the two went forward
together and he picked up the package of papers laid
carefully under the greasewood. He knew without opening
them what they were,&ndash;&ndash;the records made for her
safety, and for his, in Soledad, place of tragedies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the papers I was to put on record for her
in case&ndash;&ndash;Well, I&rsquo;ll do it, and you&rsquo;ll take care of the
copies for her, Billie, and&ndash;&ndash;and do your best for the
girl if a chance ever comes. We owe her a lot more than
she will ever guess,&ndash;&ndash;our gold come out of Mexico under
the guard arranged for her, and when I come back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Kit,&rdquo; protested Billie, &ldquo;to think of her alone with
that thieving Indian! He took flour and bacon too! And
if she hopes to find her husband&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; concluded Kit thoughtfully turning over
the certificate signed by the padre and him, of the husband&rsquo;s
safe burial in the sands of Soledad. He glanced
at Billie in doubt. One never knew how safe it was to
tell things,&ndash;&ndash;some things,&ndash;&ndash;to a woman; also Billie was
so enchanted by Jocasta&rsquo;s sad beauty, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I reckon she doesn&rsquo;t hope much along that line.
She has probably gone back to the wilderness for another
reason,&ndash;&ndash;one I never suspected until last night. And
Lark-child, we won&rsquo;t talk about that, not at least till I
return from the &lsquo;back of beyond&rsquo; over there,&rdquo; and he
pointed eastward where shafts of copper light touched
the gray veil of the morning.</p>
<p>After his first explosion of amazement Cap Pike regarded
the elopement, as he called it, very philosophically,
considering his disgust over lost mules and flour and
bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you right here last night?&rdquo; he demanded
of Kit. &ldquo;Soft as velvet and hard as hell,&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
what I said! She looks to me like a cross between a
saint in a picture frame and a love bird in a tree, and
her eyes! Yet after all no man can reckon on that blood,&ndash;&ndash;she
is only a girl of the hills down there, and the next
we hear of her she&rsquo;ll likely be leaden&rsquo; a little revolution
of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young chap made no reply, but busied himself
hastening a scant breakfast in order that the worn mules
be got to water before the worst heat of a dry day. Also
the losses to the culinary outfit did make problems for
the trip.</p>
<p>Cap eyed him askance for a space, and then with a
chuckle wilfully misconstrued his silence and lowered his
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling downhearted on your
luck, Bub, for she sure was a looker! But it&rsquo;s all in a
lifetime, and as you ramble along in years, you&rsquo;ll find that
most any hombre can steal them, and take them home, but
when it comes to getting a permanent clinch on the female
affections&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie, who was giving a short ration of water to the
burro, called across to ask what Kit was laughing at in
that hilarious way. She also stated that she did not think
it a morning for hilarity, not at all! That wonderful,
beautiful, mystery woman might be going to her death!</p>
<p>After the packs were all on, Cap Pike swung the mules
of the first wagon into the home trail and passed over
the mesa singing rakishly.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><i>Oh-h! Biddy McGee has been after me,<br />
Since I&rsquo;ve been in the army!</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And Billie turned in the saddle to take a last look over
the trail where the woman of the emerald eyes had passed
in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life I have looked, and looked into the beautiful
mirages of the south desert wondering what would
come out of it&ndash;&ndash;and <i>she</i> was the answer,&rdquo; she said, smiling
at Kit. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll feel as if it was all a dream,
all but the wonderful red gold, and you! Some fine day
we&rsquo;ll take a little <i>pasear</i> down there, I&rsquo;ll follow that dream
trail, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not!&rdquo; decided the chosen of her heart with
rude certainty. &ldquo;The dreams of that land of mirages are
likely to breed nightmares. You are on the right side
of the border for women to stay. Our old American
eagle is a pretty safe bird to roost with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; debated the only girl, &ldquo;if it comes to that,
Mexico also has the eagle, and had it first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, contrary child,&rdquo; he conceded, herding the mules
into line, &ldquo;so it has,&ndash;&ndash;but the eagle of Mexico is still
philandering with a helmeted serpent. Wise gamblers
reserve their bets on that game, we can only hope that
the eagle fights its way free!&rdquo;</p>
